  "text" : "Not OP, but I don&#x27;t see why anyone would invest in Spotify - there&#x27;s many other options out there for great music. Spotify doesn&#x27;t have sole rights to really any music as far as I know, plus music is far easier to make than movies &amp; series. If you cut me off from established artists, I can still get great joy in a multitude of music being developed today. Beyond that, there&#x27;s always the option of just giving money to the artists I like directly. The only thing Spotify has going for it is convenience, and I still would rather use Google&#x2F;Youtube music. I pay for Youtube premium and get music for free with it, as does my entire family. Furthermore, it doesn&#x27;t matter to the artists where their listeners get their music, there is no extra cost to them licensing it out to 2 or 1000 Spotifys, although there&#x27;s an argument to be made that just 1 legal license would benefit them, but with pirating I don&#x27;t there&#x27;s much to that argument.<p>There was an article in the Atlantic about how people are listening more to &quot;old&quot; music these days, which makes sense, but will have a big impact on the industry as well: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;ideas&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2022&#x2F;01&#x2F;old-music-killing-new-music&#x2F;621339&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;ideas&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2022&#x2F;01&#x2F;old-music-...</a>",
