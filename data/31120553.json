  "text" : "&gt; continue to generate revenue even after all the 3rd party content went proprietary.<p>They did and they do. They put all their money into the 1st party content. They produce huge number of bulk mediocre content and also some really good shows. I can&#x27;t see how they could do anything different. It&#x27;s not enough. They have no competitive edge  in 1st party content creation except size. That edge is in danger.<p>The competition has either deeper pockets, more content, or other income sources.<p>I have no idea about music streaming. I assume its similar network externalities, economies of size business.<p>---<p>edit:<p>As an infrequent investor, the company must do better than relevant index fund (SP500, NASDAQ composite, and so on) over the next 5-10 years to make sense to me.  Netflix may  establish itself as a good blue-chip company, but that&#x27;s not enough a reason to buy it.",
