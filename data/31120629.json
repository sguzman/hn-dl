  "text" : "The entire TV&#x2F;movie streaming industry is pushing the world back to a cable-like one, and that&#x27;s already pushing people back to pirating. There are a lot of people who were content to pay for a couple services, but even without any sports, you can easily be paying for 3 streaming services for ~$60, just to get content that used to be on Netflix (plus whatever&#x27;s been released since). Once you add one or two sports, you can be looking at prices above $100 per month.",
