  "text" : "I see a lot of focus on the &quot;lost 200 000 subscribers&quot;, but less acknowledgement that they kicked 700 000 Russians off the subscriber list, meaning they actually grew by 500 000 subscribers (still well short of wall streets expectation of 2.5 million.)<p>So in one sense it&#x27;s a one-time drop, not a trend.<p>Does Netflix have more competition than before? sure. Is it growing as fast as before? no, especially as they reach saturation in some markets. Is this the &quot;end of netflix&quot;? um... no",
