  "text" : "Agreed, I never watch TV unless it&#x27;s, weirdly enough, a social setting. My wife and I watch TV together all the time, we have shows that we like to enjoy together and talk about. My roommates and I would watch TV together all the time in college, and every now and then there will be a show that I&#x27;ll go to my friends houses to watch (game of thrones). But now that I think about it, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve watched a TV show by myself in over 20 years.",
