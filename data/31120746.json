  "text" : "&gt; Instead of producing two mediocre shows and an algorithmically designed movie every single week<p>I&#x27;m actually kinda torn about that statement. While i usually prefer shows by other studios for quality, i&#x27;ve watched some Netflix Originals that were rather good, and especially some &quot;foreign language&quot; ones that i would most likely never have watched otherwise.<p>Most of the Netflix Originals are not huge budget productions, but especially their foreign stuff sometimes proves that less is more. They tell interesting stories in &quot;good enough&quot; settings for them to be enjoyable.",
