  "text" : "I haven&#x27;t &quot;watched television&quot; in over 20 years. At the same time, the internet (YouTube to a large degree) has crept in to steal away my time.<p>I am thankful though that YouTube sucked so bad for so long because I spent a lot of time with my kids when they were young, reading to them, biking with them, taking them on road trips. Cutting the cord was the idea when my first daughter was born - to have the kids grow up without television (we would put on over-the-air PBS kid&#x27;s shows when they were young but it was pretty much only hotels stays when they would see <i>Sponge Bob</i> or whatever, ha ha).",
