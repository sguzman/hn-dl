  "text" : "Netflix always had a terrible business model dependent on transient properties of the media environment. I thought from the beginning they were not masters of their own fate (remember Redbox&#x27;s hack to get around publisher restrictions?  Weird streaming windows even from the streaming era&#x27;s earliest days?) and once they started spending the big bucks to try and stay afloat it was clear they were doomed.  They were only in &quot;FAANG&quot; to make the acronym funny.<p>I expect the entire streaming business to follow the cable TV model: 1 - start with a paid, high quality and&#x2F;or increased supply without ads; 2 - bleed ads into some of the streams because the first stage was unsustainable; 3 - race to the bottom with bundles, because the individual streams are too expensive. Expect Comcast to be the big winner here through a roll up and cross-sale of carriage to their cable channels into streaming bundles (because aggregated bundle fees will provide at least some revenue without the cost of running your own streaming platform.<p>Youtube ought to win this battle but have to date demonstrated little competence. Comcast is the superpredator.",
