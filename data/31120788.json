  "text" : "<i>What has gone wrong with our world that making a 6 billion dollar a year profit is considered a problem?</i><p>Because it <i>is</i> a problem.<p>Firstly, it&#x27;s a problem because stock prices are a measure of predicted future value. The profit today is mostly irrelevant. In order to make a profit on shares the business has to be in a position to do better in the future. If it doesn&#x27;t then people won&#x27;t believe it&#x27;ll do better even farther in to the future, so they won&#x27;t bid more for the shares than they&#x27;re worth today. That means investors can&#x27;t make a profit. If you bought Netflix shares in the past you&#x27;ll lose money. That&#x27;s a problem.<p>Secondly, and in my opinion more importantly, Netflix (and every other tech unicorn) use their shares as a hiring incentive. If the shares are going the wrong way then good hires will refuse offers and go elsewhere. A big chunk of renumeration in tech is predicated on people getting stock instead of cash because that&#x27;s worth more to the individual and cheaper for the business. If that fails then the business has to start dipping in to that $6bn profit to replace people who leave, or to acquire businesses, or just to maintain the status quo.<p>It isn&#x27;t hard to imagine a scenario where a $6bn profit turns into a loss within a decade or less. The driving force behind people saying Netflix has a problem is that they&#x27;re predicting that the future of the company isn&#x27;t good.<p>I mean, they might be wrong and Netflix might be fine, and ultimately even if things go badly Netflix is never going to &quot;fail&quot; because it&#x27;ll get bought long before that happens, but if you hold Netflix stock it&#x27;s entirely reasonable to be worried despite the healthy profit they make.",
