  "text" : "I&#x27;ve never been into &quot;flow tv&quot;, and about 2 decades ago i simply stopped watching anything but the news, and that only for 30-60 minutes per day, and shortly after that i simply read the news on the internet and completely stopped watching &quot;normal&quot; tv.<p>Since then, i&#x27;ve only had streaming services, and my consumption is somewhere around 3-5 45 minute episodes per week. I have watched maybe 4 normal length movies since i had kids 13 years ago, and zero &quot;extended length&quot; (3 hours&#x27;ish) movies.<p>Recently though, i find myself to be even more picky. These days i still watch 3-5 episodes per week, but my viewing is usually done late friday and saturday evening, and the rest of the week i generally prefer a good book instead.<p>In April alone, i&#x27;ve watched 5 x 45 minute episodes in total, and read 3 books of 800 pages or more, so perhaps i&#x27;m coming full circle :)",
