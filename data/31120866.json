  "text" : "What&#x27;s supposed to happen is that profitable companies start paying dividends to their shareholders.  If you&#x27;re getting dividends, then you don&#x27;t mind if the value of your shares is staying flat or even dropping a little.  The original purpose of owning shares in a company wasn&#x27;t only that the value of the shares themselves would increase, but that they&#x27;d pay dividends so shareholders can make a profit over the life of a company.<p>As far as I know, Netflix shares, much like shares in many other tech companies, do not pay any dividend.  Perhaps it&#x27;s time they begin.",
