  "text" : "nothing precludes Netflix from having great content, their quantity over quality model is annoying. The &quot;stars&quot; or &quot;match&quot; of recommended content has no basing on the enjoyment by other users as it is purely algorithmic while having the visual component of looking like reviews. They try to induce fear-of-missing-out with their trending list, which I also don&#x27;t trust due to the likelihood of it not involving any humans at all like their other feature. People catch on and walk away.",
