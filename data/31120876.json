If you want access to all the content all at once, then pay up.<p>If you want access to specific content at the specific time you want, then pay then, watch, and cancel the subscription if there was one.<p>This latter option was not available before, and it is now.  I am loving the new system which cuts out the middleman (cable&#x2F;satellite tv) that was able to jerk around both me and the content seller.<p>The next problem needing to be solved is reducing copyright length to 10 years or so.  That is what will make the price of content go down by increasing the number of content sellers.",
