  "text" : "I only use Netflix and Prime, and both feel really stale to me. It&#x27;s all &quot;content&quot; - good to very good production values designed to fill a gap and appeal to a demographic. But very repetitive and production line, with no passion projects, nothing too arty or quirky, nothing outside of the box, no <i>surprises.</i><p>Some of it is quite watchable, but none of it is exciting or fresh. It&#x27;s all some combination of stock soapy characters and themes in stock genre settings, usually with some comedy&#x2F;sex&#x2F;violence&#x2F;horror added for stickiness.<p>Netflix could easily throw some money at graduate film makers and say &#x27;Make something no one has seen before.&#x27; That might or might not help retention, but it&#x27;s hard to shake the feeling Netflix are deliberately aiming for the middle of the bell curve as creative policy, and missing opportunities to lead instead of trying to play it safe.",
