  "text" : "&quot;The thing I find interesting with Netflix is how much they spend on content and what a terrible rate of return it has.&quot;<p>Bingo - that&#x27;s the real reason for the long term (or secular ) decline we&#x27;re seeing. With 0% interest rates, it didn&#x27;t matter what the payoff time horizon for Netflix was. With 4% interest rates, longer horizons are gone. Couple that with Netflix being a discretionary expense, and we see the compounding effects of inflation.<p>Two things will happen - we&#x27;ll see the real value of Netflix&#x27;s library content. Do people really value that at $12 per month.<p>And we&#x27;ll also likely see an appreciation in the value of the library content from legacy studios like Paramount&#x2F;NBCU etc. - who have complained for the longest time that this is undervalued relative to Netflix.",
