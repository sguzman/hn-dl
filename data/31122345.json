Then I think, how do I find it, will I need a new subscription, it&#x27;s probably not even available in my geographical area ... or I could probably go to a Torrent site and be watching it in 5 minutes (the limitation being the speed of my internet connection).<p>As copyright is system granted by the demos I&#x27;d love to force federation by creating a &#x27;most-favoured nation&#x27;-type deal where if you offer content to one delivery company you have to make it available to all (maybe after a 1 year exclusivity period) for the same price. Under such a regime everyone gets paid but artificial monopolies are restricted (such monopolies don&#x27;t help the <i>demos</i> so why allow copyright to be used to create them??).<p>The proliferation of content provider apps is getting silly and we should mould copyright to serve the people.",
