  "text" : "Absolutely, Netflix would be 1000 times better if they just let me sort, filter and find content based on concrete metadata. Instead, I&#x27;m forced to rely on their recommendation algorithms that purport to know what I want to watch, but for some reason keep recommending low quality content in languages I&#x27;m just not interested in. I&#x27;d be happy if I could just filter Netflix to only show me content with original audio in languages I speak. The few shows I&#x27;m interested in watching with subtitles or dubbed audio are things I can search for on a case by base basis. And don&#x27;t get me started on Netflix&#x27;s non-intuitive categories which seem more intent on forcing me to view ideologically motivated content than on helping me to find content in a category I&#x27;m interested in. I don&#x27;t want to search for &quot;Christian Films with Family Values&quot; nor do I want to watch &quot;Films With Black Female Leads&quot;. Nothing wrong with those types of films, but I&#x27;m searching by &quot;Action&quot;, &quot;Romance&quot;, &quot;Comedy&quot;, &quot;Sci-Fi&quot; etc.",
