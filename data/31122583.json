  "text" : "Netflix used to offer movies that were previously shown in theaters. You could get a DVD in the mail, and watch a movie you hadn&#x27;t seen otherwise. When streaming became a thing years later, you could again watch a movie you hadn&#x27;t seen otherwise.<p>We used to watch five to ten movies a month via Netflix. We haven&#x27;t used it in two or three years now.",
