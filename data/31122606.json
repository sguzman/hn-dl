  "text" : "Since Netflix is sticking with the binge-watch release model they pioneered, I wish they would provide a 1 or 2 week-long &quot;binge&quot; one-time payment option. They could charge as much as for a month&#x27;s subscription, but you wouldn&#x27;t have to deal with canceling your subscription when you&#x27;re done watching the 2 or 3 shows you actually signed up to watch. $20 for a limited time, no hassle binge is a pretty good deal; it&#x27;s cheaper than buying a single movie on Prime Video and much cheaper than buying movie tickets for me and my partner.",
