In other words, just by moving the mouse you would be under threat of accidentally distracting yourself. Maybe some people don&#x27;t feel the same way, but for me, it was destabilizing to the point that I couldn&#x27;t recall what it was I was searching for &#x2F; interested in in the first place. I think they have &quot;fixed&quot; this in the past year, but there are still times when auto-play completely interrupts my thought&#x2F;intentionality.",
