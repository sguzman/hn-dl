  "text" : "I think Netflix&#x27;s big problem is I&#x27;ll occasionally discover something amazing, and then look at the release date and wonder &quot;why did it take so long to find this?&quot;<p>If the experience browsing their catalog wasn&#x27;t so awful, I&#x27;d be more inclined to try and use the service. Instead, after I&#x27;ve finished something good, I don&#x27;t tend to come back to Netflix for awhile - it&#x27;s easier to just watch stuff on Youtube because I know how to navigate it, the search works well, and the recommendations are actually decent.<p>I remember a couple weeks ago, Blade Runner 2049 was the first thing that popped up when I logged into Netflix. I was so happy to see it there, but when I went back the next night to watch it, it wasn&#x27;t there (which is fine, the homepage isn&#x27;t static). So I went to search for it, and &quot;Blade Runner&quot; returned nothing relevant (nor did &quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot;). I had to search &quot;2049&quot; to find it, and after the movie ended, Netflix recommended the first Blade Runner (which also didn&#x27;t show up in any of my searches).<p>The search isn&#x27;t always this bad (both Blade Runner movies show up in search the way I would expect them to now), but still...even when I know something great is on Netflix, it can be an utter pain to get to. It&#x27;s like they&#x27;re trying to get me to go with the mediocre recommendations instead of watching the good stuff that I know is on there.<p>It&#x27;s so annoying that if I was the one paying for it, I&#x27;d cancel my subscription. And I remember things used to be a lot better, which just makes it all the more frustrating when looking for something good.",
