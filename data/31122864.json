  "text" : "The biggest issue is there is too much competition and too many streaming services. When Netflix was the only game in town it was a no brainer. However I&#x27;m currently paying HBO, Hulu, Disney, Apple and Amazon along with Netflix. each platform has something worth watching, but not all are worth paying for. I should cancel Apple+ and I most of whats on Amazon is terrible but it comes with Prime already. I still think Netflix is worth keeping compared to some of the other services but they keep raising the price.",
