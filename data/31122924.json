Their recommendation algorithms didn&#x27;t solve 1.<p>The root cause of it all is their odd focus on expensive originals over third party content. Their catalogue is just not deep enough if you remove all the subpar content. Before using Netflix I engaged in massive piracy for over ten years, and I&#x27;m considering it again - this time in smaller amounts, because I don&#x27;t have that much free time anymore.",
