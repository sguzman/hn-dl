  "text" : "Agreed. I have never used such a non-deterministic UI. Every time I load the app I have to hunt around to find the show I last watched and continue it. It feels like itâ€™s in a different place every single time.<p>And actually trying to browse the catalog is painful.<p>I like some of their content but I really hate the Netflix apps. (Not to mention weird subtitle issues and play position sync issues).<p>The one thing I will say though is I cannot remember the last time I saw a single bit of buffering. Everything starts playing immediately, every time. The actual reliability of the streaming itself is superb.",
