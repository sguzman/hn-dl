  "text" : "Netflix <i>had</i> a long tail, when it was a DVD rental service.   Netflix streaming has never had a long tail and definitely don&#x27;t now.   They presently have less than 4000 movies, including all their &#x27;originals&#x27; (which should probably be called &#x27;derivatives&#x27;.)  This is scarcely a long tail as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  I cancelled my account years ago because there was nothing I wanted to watch.  I realized I spent two or three times as much time browsing the catalogue as actually watching something, and half the time I was settling for something I&#x27;d already seen.  Nothing I&#x27;ve seen or heard even remotely tempts me to come back.",
