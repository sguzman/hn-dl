  "text" : "I disagree with the parent comment that is is commonplace (I think it is rare) but I have definitely seen it. Several episodes of shows for girls under 5 have the trope &quot;boys&#x2F;grownups say girls can&#x27;t do X&quot; which the girl characters have to overcome. This is absurd material to expose to children of that age, who have never been exposed to the concept outside of children&#x27;s programming! It&#x27;s so far removed from the reality of young girls today it makes me doubt that the people writing this stuff even have children.",
