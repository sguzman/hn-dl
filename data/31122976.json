  "text" : "During quarantine I switched to mostly movies. They require more singular focus (it&#x27;s harder to watch a movie while doing other things), don&#x27;t really have the binging problem (2 hour and done instead of just continually extensions of 45 minutes), and are generally higher quality. I&#x27;ve seen some very good (Memories, Son of the White Mare), some very bad (I went through a Bakshi phase), and overall decided I prefer this to watching yet another sitcom or graphic novel adaptation on tv.",
