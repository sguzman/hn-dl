  "text" : "That&#x27;s not how English works. &quot;Stole&quot;, &quot;steal&quot;, etc., have meanings beyond just illegally depriving someone of physical property. Here are several examples of correct usage of &quot;steal&quot; or &quot;stole&quot; that have nothing to do with illegally taking property.<p>• Someone says they do not like cats and have no interest in having one as a pet. A cute stray kitten shows up on their doorstep, they take pity and feed it. They fall in love with it and keep it. They might say that the kitten &quot;stole&quot; their heart.<p>• An actor playing a minor role in a play gives a performance that outshines the performance of the stars. Many would say that the actor &quot;stole&quot; the show.<p>• An employee of a rival company poses as a janitor to gain access to your lab and takes a photo of a whiteboard containing the formula for a chemical that is a trade secret in your manufacturing process. It would be common to say that the rival company &quot;stole&quot; your secret formula.<p>• When crackers gain access to a company&#x27;s list of customer email addresses, passwords, or credit card numbers, it is commonly said that the data was &quot;stolen&quot;.<p>• Alice is Bob&#x27;s fiancé. Mallory woos Alice without Bob&#x27;s knowledge. Alice elopes with Mallory. Most would find it acceptable if Bob said that Mallory &quot;stole&quot; his fiancé.<p>• A team that has been behind since the start of the game but wins on a last second improbable play is often said to have &quot;stolen&quot; the game.",
