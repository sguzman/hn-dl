  "text" : "In the 1990s some homes would have several screens of cable TV, so several people in the same home could watch different things at the same time. Parents with teenage children, for example. Because of the physical cables it only worked in one home - when the kids moved out, they had to pay for their own cable or go without.<p>Netflix presumably hopes to achieve the same thing: Letting kids share their parents&#x27; accounts before they leave home, but not after.",
