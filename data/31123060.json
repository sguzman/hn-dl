  "text" : "There were a few years were I literally stopped all torrenting.  Netflix and Amazon had everything I wanted.  Sure, there were a few things that didn&#x27;t exist, but I was too lazy to go after that minor amount of content.  I was fully legal and paying for everything.  I was fine with it.<p>Then, the great splintering happened.  I currently pay for 5 services, but that doesn&#x27;t cover even 1&#x2F;2 of what I want to watch.<p>All the content owners said to themselves &quot;we can be Netflix or Amazon Prime, too&quot; and they pulled their content into their own services.<p>But the biggest problem: the user experience absolutely sucks now.  It&#x27;s so hard to find stuff and remember where things are, there&#x27;s no universal search.  I have to use justwatch.com on my phone when I want to sit down to watch something new, which might mean a trip to the computer to download it if one of the many services I already pay for don&#x27;t have it.",
