  "text" : "It doesn&#x27;t matter how you rationalise it. Someone created content with the intention of it being consumed for a fee. You downloaded it, likely from someone who illegally copied&#x2F;reproduced it.<p>Maybe I didn&#x27;t &quot;steal&quot;, but I contributed to criminal activity.<p>Sure, copyright laws can seem absurd, but if you disagree with the laws, consider the ethics.<p>How would you feel if you have a business, I steal from you, and then go give random people your content? This especially when it starts to drive into your revenues.<p>&quot;Only digital copy&quot; is disingenuous. If the cost of producing the digital copy is say $40mm (an amount article says some Netflix movies can cost).<p>They&#x27;re making copies from a digital copy, and their business is to sell access to them. If their model is &quot;we&#x27;ll replicate this copy 500 million times, and charge users $0.10 a view&quot;, every 10 copies viewed elsewhere is $1 lost.<p>Should a service raise the fee to say $0.12 to better cover costs?<p>Ultimately, theft is often subsidised by paying customers.<p>I&#x27;m also guilty of this. I download torrents where:<p>* I can&#x27;t buy something because it&#x27;s not available due to region restrictions, and I can&#x27;t buy it via VPN (looking at Disney+)<p>* I can&#x27;t buy it anywhere altogether.<p>Where I used to download maybe 50 torrents a year a decade ago, I probably do it &lt;5 times a year now. It&#x27;s stealing, or consuming stolen content.<p>The pricing strategies of big corp is a separate accessibility issue.",
