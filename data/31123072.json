I have friends in the industry working on a Netflix series, and the amount of political correctness being forced on them from the Netflix side is insane.  \nI cannot give a specific example due to exposing which show this may be on, but if the stories I hear or true, the Netflix staff must do a lot of Yoga cause the stuff they force to change is a stretch.  \nThe artists I know on the show went from being excited, to just there for a paycheck after certain fruits were deemed racist around black characters (not watermelons), and a LGBT plotline was forced into a childrens show just because.",
