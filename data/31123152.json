Netflix and Prime are particularly terrible because of the volume of content, much of it absolute garbage, they have online.<p>1. I want to find my own shit with filters, not by scrolling through endless reams of D- grade cable TV quality shows.<p>2. I want major efforts from networks and studios, not homemade content. I know I may be in the minority here, but I strongly prefer HBOMax right now (which I get for &#x27;free&#x27; with my phone plan) because the content is aligned here coupled with their own solid content, not D+ grade self-created content.",
