  "text" : "&gt; - there is too much political agenda sold even in children shows (Kids really dont need this kind of crap)<p>What do you mean by &quot;political agenda&quot;?

Or just stuff like &quot;gay people exist and should be treated with respect&quot;?<p>Also, when I was a kid I would listen to conservative talk radio <i>all the time</i>. It&#x27;s the only thing my dad would listen to while driving. And I don&#x27;t think it was corrupting or traumatizing or anything.",
