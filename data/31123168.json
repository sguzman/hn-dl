  "text" : "The algorithmic feed alone is reason to leave Netflix. Briefly, I had Netflix working on a 3rd-party add-on for Kodi. (it&#x27;s since broken)<p>It was beautiful:<p>- There were no video previews.<p>- All selection was text-based only.<p>- There was no algorithmic feed: only lists based on category &#x2F; genre &#x2F; etc.<p>If Netflix offered this, I might actually pay for it. For now, I&#x27;m just using a relative&#x27;s login, and I won&#x27;t be paying if they boot us off.",
