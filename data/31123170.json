Or I could wait until we get a good rain and pour it into the drainage ditch in front of my house, where it will eventually end up somewhere in Puget Sound.<p>The amount of oil is small enough that it would have absolutely no measurable effect whatsoever on Puget Sound.<p>Would you say that it is therefore OK for me to dump it in the ditch?",
