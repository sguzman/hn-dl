On the other hand if HBOMax hiked their prices to $30&#x2F;mo I wouldn&#x27;t blink.<p>For me I associate the big red &quot;N&quot; with bad content. So when I open Netflix and see the red &quot;N&quot; plastered on every thumbnail the algo serves up, I immediately wanted to close the app. I eventually felt tired of batting away their originals to find good content so I unsubscribed.<p>I don&#x27;t know how many other people actually feel the same way, but it seems pretty clear to me that their subscriber base doesn&#x27;t like Netflix&#x27;s original content as much as Netflix does.",
