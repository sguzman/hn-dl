  "text" : "I particularly hate the way they keep pushing serial killer documentaries, and there seems to be little way to get them to stop. When it&#x27;s late at night and I&#x27;m trying to find something relaxing to watch before going to bed, the last thing I want to see is a serial killer&#x27;s face staring at me and then footage of them starting to play. It ruins my night. Honestly that&#x27;s been the last straw for me. They&#x27;re happy to force their customers to see disturbing things, as long as it boosts engagement.",
