  "text" : "I don&#x27;t know how to phrase this nicely, but this is precisely the type of Hacker News nerd-blindness that I find amazing. It&#x27;s &quot;easier&quot;? Is it? For young children who want to watch their kids shows and don&#x27;t know what 4k means? For grandparents who want to see some k-dramas and have no clue about DRM or geo-locked? Sure, Netflix has issues and it&#x27;s made some bad decisions, but let&#x27;s not delude ourselves here. The group of people who are comfortable pirating media and find it &quot;easier&quot; than Netflix is at least an order of magnitude smaller than Netflix&#x27;s user base.<p>I&#x27;m sorry, I just find it really absurd when people claim something is easier when it&#x27;s just not. Perhaps you find it to be a better trade off, but it is not easier.",
