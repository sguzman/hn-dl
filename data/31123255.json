Also gibberish.<p>I mean, as long as we&#x27;re going to be spewing content-free sentences I might as well get mine in.<p>&quot;Woke&quot; isn&#x27;t a useful term because today in 2022 it basically means &quot;anything a conservative doesn&#x27;t like&quot;. &quot;Woke mind virus&quot; is particularly egregious -that&#x27;s pure hyperbole without even a pretense of meaning.<p>The problem with Netflix in the main isn&#x27;t that they show too many people who are white, or show two many people who are LGBTQ+. The problem with Netflix IN THE MAIN is that they are cracking down on a subscription policy no one wants while increasing prices beyond what people believe are reasonable while at the same time hemmoraging content. It doesn&#x27;t help that they have demonstrated over the last decade that you cannot rely on their own content to actually tell a full story (because it will get cancelled prematurely).<p>None of that has anything to do with the &quot;woke&quot; bugbear -it would be equally true if Netflix&#x27;s political stance matched OAN.",
