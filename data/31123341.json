I maintain a large media server.<p>The end result of my pirating is a media service that is easier to use, is higher quality and requires less effort than a streaming service (though initial costs and setup time were high).<p>I also pay for 3 streaming services that go unused, and this covers about half or maybe 3&#x2F;4 of what I watch.<p>Streaming is in a dangerous place when piracy works better, looks better and is more convenient.",
