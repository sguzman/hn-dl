  "text" : "I&#x27;d be careful to make a claim as big as &quot;the bottom is dropping out,&quot; but Netflix is facing a few headwinds.<p>- Lots of competition, some more serious (Disney+) than others (Amazon)<p>- Nearing the top of the streaming adoption curve<p>- End of the stay-at-home covid bump<p>The covid impact is noise in the long (5+ years) term.<p>Reaching full adoption is a sign of maturity overtaking growth. You run the company differently, but it&#x27;s not &quot;the bottom dropping out.&quot;<p>Competition is rough. The competitors have deep pockets and back catalogs, but consumers have no appetite for 6 separate services. This is where I&#x27;d be worried.<p>I empathize with the recommendation and UI gripes, but I doubt they&#x27;re driving Netflix&#x27;s woes.",
