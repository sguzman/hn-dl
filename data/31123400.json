Making movies would be impossible to be without your<p>- Lesser Known actors\n- Assistant Directors\n- Stunt Coordinators\n- 2nd Unit Directors\n- Stunt Performers<p>and I&#x27;m sure there are others. Residuals factor into our income, allow us to qualify for health insurance, empower our unions, and provide a stable income to continue working in an unstable career.<p>All so we can make better entertainment for you! When you pirate, you&#x27;re stealing money from us.",
