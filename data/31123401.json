  "text" : "The problem with this analysis is that it assume everyone has the same tastes, and stuff you don&#x27;t personally like is &quot;garbage.&quot; The reality is that people have a lot of different tastes. I don&#x27;t think you should judge Netflix by what you don&#x27;t like; only by whether it has enough of the things that you <i>do</i> like.<p>For example, I&#x27;ve been enjoying &quot;Handsome Siblings,&quot; a Chinese wuxia show that&#x27;s pretty shallow. It&#x27;s not going to win any awards for writing or acting, but it&#x27;s beautifully produced and good mindless fun.<p>To some people, it&#x27;s filler junk (worseâ€”<i>subtitled</i> junk). To me, it&#x27;s perfect for passing the time on a long plane ride.",
