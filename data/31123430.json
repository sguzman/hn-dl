  "text" : "The sorting is brutal.<p>The sorts should be partitioned.  For a given category, that list they show you?  Movies you have seen and rated down should be the very, very last on the list.  Then movies you seen and rated up would be just before that.  Then movies you haven&#x27;t seen, but are older.  Up front should be movies you haven&#x27;t seen but are new to Netflix.<p>A movie should appear in no more than three categories, because they like to pack these with spam.  I marked horror as my #1 category, why do I have to scroll through a ton of stuff like &quot;Strong Female-Led Dramas&quot; to get to it?",
