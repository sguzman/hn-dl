  "text" : "I doubt most of the subscription loss is attributable to reasons that most HN types go on about (the rants about wokeness, not enough scifi, carousel UI, pirating etc...).<p>What&#x27;s probably going on is after after a few years of pandemic isolation and Netflix binging, the arrival of pandemic triggered inflation, and overall higher employment rates, people just have less interest, time, and money to binge watch longer form content. Many are probably consuming shorter form content (like TikTok), or enjoying more time in public.<p>We economize by scrutinizing our spending of both money and time.  When we feel we have less of both of those, streaming services are an obvious &quot;nice to have&quot; for a lot of people that can be cut from their lives with minimal feeling of loss, especially since it can be substituted with fulfilling time spent with other people.<p>Also, if you&#x27;re paying an extra $150 a month for energy utilities and gasoline, it kind of makes sense that you might cancel a streaming service that you watch once or twice a week.<p>These days the time I spent on streaming services during the pandemic is more likely than ever to be spent having a beer on a neighbor&#x27;s porch (with them of course!).",
