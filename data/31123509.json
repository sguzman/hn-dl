  "text" : "It&#x27;s not easier. I&#x27;ve got a BS in EE and am old enough to have downloaded episodes of the TV show 24 over 56k using early BitTorrent. I&#x27;ve successfully set up plex (which requires an in house server&#x2F;spare pc), sonarr, radarr, usenet, etc. I&#x27;m probably the 99% percentile in ability to pirate. And its not easier than netflix.<p>90% of people I know probably couldn&#x27;t set this up. And the other 10% would spend more time dicking around with the set up than they would using netflix or the other services.<p>GabeN is not correct. Piracy is a money problem. Free is very enticing.",
