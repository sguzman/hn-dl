  "text" : "I clicked that link expecting to see opinions on “Trickle down economics” or “abortion” or “ownership of the means of production” being fed to children but all I see is: “Same sex couples exist.”<p>“Same sex couples exist” is not a political view. It is a reality of fact that children of all ages already know. My kid’s best friend since age 5 has two moms. Trust me: she has no concept of what politics are but knows what two loving parents are.<p>If “gays exist” is the example of politics jammed into TV, that’s a really really weak example.",
