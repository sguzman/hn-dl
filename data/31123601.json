  "text" : "I feel what you say too, that all the content feels samey.  But I&#x27;ll offer a suggestion that works for me: try some animation.  That&#x27;s where you get the passion projects that can feel <i>different</i>.  Animated characters and settings can be far more expressive and varied and fresh, compared to the stock sameyness you get from live action.<p>The new She-Ra on Netflix was the best thing I&#x27;ve watched in quite some time.  It&#x27;s not a kiddie show, it works for all ages, think like Pixar movies.  Other great cartoons across a variety of streaming services: Steven Universe, Gravity Falls, Owl House, Star Trek Lower Decks, also the more mainstream Bob&#x27;s Burgers.  If you want something fresh to watch, try animation.",
