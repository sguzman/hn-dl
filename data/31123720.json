In the case of the crackers breaching an email list, many laws are broken, but I doubt &quot;theft,&quot; or anything like it, would be one of them. In the case of the corporate espionage, if this is theft, it&#x27;s theft of intellectual property. And that makes it the most direct comparison to content piracy, but it doesn&#x27;t advance the conversation because it&#x27;s the same debate.",
