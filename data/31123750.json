People who accusatorily use the word in reference to copyright violation are leaning on the &#x27;illegal acts of theft&#x27; meaning of the term to add apparent moral weight to their argument.  But when challenged on that, they retreat into these more diverse meanings of the word and pretend they never meant it that specific way.   It&#x27;s a <i>Motte-and-Bailey</i> tactic.",
