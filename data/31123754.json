Sure, no problem, if you don&#x27;t buy it in the bundle, the individual channel cost is $29 per month!</i>&quot;<p>---<p>That is <i>THE</i> failure of &quot;regulation&quot; ; <i>THE GOVERNMENT WILL MANDATE THROUGH LOBBIED REGULATION THAT ONE MUST HAVE THIS [SERVICE] - HOWEVER, WE WILL NOT REGULATE HOW MUCH YU CAN BE CHARGED FOR THE SERVICE, BUT WE WILL FINE AND PUNISH YOU IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THIS SERVICE.</i>",
