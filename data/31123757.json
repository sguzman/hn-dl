We agree, not having to deal with all these streaming services is easier than having to deal with all these streaming services.<p>But if we&#x27;re talking about the people who are buying all the streaming services, it&#x27;s currently easier to pirate. I get that you haven&#x27;t taken two seconds to do any amount of research on the matter and that complete lack of any experience whatsoever gives you a sense of expertise to call other people blind and absurd, but consider that maybe you just don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re talking about?",
