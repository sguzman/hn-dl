  "text" : "Am I the only person that hates Steam?<p>The UX is crap; the info architecture is obscure; it doesn&#x27;t work well on macOS (or at all if I use the wrong file system); it uses confusing labels for the stash of stuff I&#x27;ve already bought. I don&#x27;t use it often enough to know if my usr&#x2F;pwd is still valid (it is, fortunately). It had some slightly odd 2FA type thing the last time I logged in. It just gives me the impression that it wants to hide games from me that I&#x27;ve already bought and to make new ones hard to find. I&#x27;d rather have discs in boxes taking up space (tbf I also collect vinyl so maybe I&#x27;m just anachronistic?)<p>The only good thing going for it is that it doesn&#x27;t ever email me junk.",
