I strongly suspect people saying that would actually pay for a decent amount of it if piracy wasn&#x27;t an option.<p>And the number of pirate I know would plop down 15 bucks for a movies (since CAMs and TSs are terrible copies) but won&#x27;t pay for a movie on VOD (since they can pirate it in clear 4k) confirms my suspicions.",
