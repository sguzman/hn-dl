  "text" : "Yes, obviously.  I really don’t see how one could possibly sympathize with this argument.  Say I go to a bakery and I only “sort of” want a cookie.  I’m not hungry enough to pay for it, so I just take it, and claim “I’m not actually stealing because I wasn’t going to pay for it anyway“.<p>You could claim it’s different with digital goods, but it’s not.  Money still went into making that good (whether that’s software or a movie or even just a picture) and you’re still getting the benefits of owning that good without paying for it.  Put another way, how does not caring enough about something entitle you to ownership?<p>So you are absolutely stealing whether you would “have paid for it“ or not.",
