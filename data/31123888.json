  "text" : "You aren&#x27;t the only one.   Steam is DRM with good PR.  Much of the goodwill gamers have for Steam is based on misconceptions, rumors, or delusions, particularly: <i>&quot;If Valve ever goes out of business, they said they&#x27;ll lift all the DRM for the games I&#x27;ve bought&quot;</i>  I&#x27;ve heard that from so many gamers it isn&#x27;t even funny, it&#x27;s a widespread misconception and it&#x27;s obvious horse shit.  <i>Maybe</i> Valve has or once had that intention with their own in-house games, but they wouldn&#x27;t even have the legal right to do something like that for 99.99% of the Steam catalogue.<p>Even for the in-house games, you have to be naive to trust any sort of promise from a commercial software product that isn&#x27;t in a contract.   Notch supposedly once promised that Minecraft would eventually become open source; well that plan evaporated when Microsoft waved a few billion dollars in front of him.  Maybe he meant it at the time he said it, but that doesn&#x27;t count for anything.",
