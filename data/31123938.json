It&#x27;s probably naive to think that would work for a bunch of reasons (Who exactly runs this?  Are they a for-profit monopoly now?  Who will fund the content if there&#x27;s no monopoly rent?) but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s crazy to imagine a service that works more like it. We went to all the effort of unbundling cable and now we just have a different set of bundles. It&#x27;s a little better, but they&#x27;ve fallen back on old habits.",
