  "text" : "I&#x27;d been looking for reason to get rid of Netflix once they made it impossible to adequately curate the user experience — they kept shoving content I didn&#x27;t want to see at me, as well as content I&#x27;d already seen, and gave me no way to exclude shows or types of shows from being presented to me. Netflix is amazingly anti-user, and anti-user choice. The autoplay of short clips they introduced made it actively anti-user.<p>The straw that broke the camel&#x27;s back for us was the disappearance of a deep catalog and only one or two new shows which were worth attention — if we really want to see them, we&#x27;ll sign on for a month next year and binge-watch through them, then drop the service again. This is the model we&#x27;re going to be going forward with any such service.",
