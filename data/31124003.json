  "text" : "I was at a friends house, he was starting GameOfThrones.  I was like &quot;you going to cancel hbo after??&quot; He explained he was pirating.  But! He is non technical (a nurse by trade).  I was very confused asked to see his setup.  He walked over to small black box under his tv.  I was fascinated. It was a raseberry pi enclosure with hdmi out, it was prepackaged - networking p2p software for looking up stolen items, a UI better than netflix.  All he did was take it out of the box, plug in the HDMI, and start watching UNLIMITED content on any streaming service I have heard of.",
