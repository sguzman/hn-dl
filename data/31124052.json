  "text" : "I was terribly skeptical to Steam when it launched, as I am to all online&#x2F;hosted services. What if they just remove a game I&#x27;m using? Does all my games stop working if they turn off their servers? Am I really going to have to be online whenever I want to play?<p>But I gave in after several years, and now I&#x27;m a quite happy Steam user on Linux. It works as advertised, and the only issue I have is that I haven&#x27;t found a way to filter games for «Linux support» and a genre at the same time. I&#x27;ve used EXT4 and BTRFS as file systems while using Steam, and never had any issues with that either.<p>I&#x27;m inclined to agree with Gabe. I&#x27;ve never spent as much money on games as after I got Steam. It makes it really easy to get a new game. Without Steam, I&#x27;d probably just go without. I have lots of things to spend my time on, and sometimes I&#x27;m even a little bit bummed that wasting time on games is an option on Linux these days...",
