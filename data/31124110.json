  "text" : "I even have Plex set up with (mostly) ripped DVD content but I still subscribe to a few streaming services and buy&#x2F;rent a la carte now and then. The fragmentation is annoying but subscribing&#x2F;unsubscribing is pretty low friction. Though I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see more discounting for longer subscription terms.<p>Of course, what was (past tense) also annoying was paying $100&#x2F;month for a cable bundle that I rarely watched.<p>It&#x27;s also the case that I have access to a ton of video and don&#x27;t consider much to be &quot;must see.&quot;<p>And to the topic at hand, I may very well cancel Netflix one of these days. There&#x27;s some stuff I haven&#x27;t watched yet but after I get through that I may well drop it.",
