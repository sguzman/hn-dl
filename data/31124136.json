  "text" : "Uh huh, I&#x27;ll stop stealing from you when <i>you</i> stop stealing from me.<p>Advertizements everywhere stealing my attention, public space, and landscape beauty. Stealth taxes on empty hard drives and other storage media. Hardware-destroying rootkits and other malware (lost a DVD drive to DRM, will you reimburse me?). Draconian control mechanisms and lobbying stealing my control of the devices I own. Mountains upon mountains of disposable plastic promotional crap stealing my planet and ecosystem.<p>I&#x27;m not stealing from you. I&#x27;m extracting some small reparation for the many toxic behaviors your industry engages in. When you start offering an honest product I&#x27;ll start honest buying. And I do - I pay more combined to good people producing good content via Patreon than a monthly Netflix subscription.",
