  "text" : "The reason you used to have Netflix was that you could binge watch old shows.\nAs Netflix lost the license to these many seasons deep shows and replaced them with single seasons of just a handful of episodes people got less and less out of it, but it became much more expensive for Netflix and so they raised their price.<p>We need a &#x27;must-license&#x27; system for TV-shows and movies, so that any movie that is available on one streaming service must be available to any other streaming service for the same terms. No doubt this will not mean that all movies are available on all streaming services, but it will mean that there will be actual competition.",
