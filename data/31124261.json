It&#x27;s like saying the CLI is easier than a GUI - sure, for you.<p>The things this person lists are things I agree with, however. I actually have Amazon Prime Video but still enjoyed watching my friend&#x27;s pirated copies on Plex, because there is no way to force-disable shitty compression levels, even if I have gigabit Internet.<p>Also, my friend can make sure their video library never changes or goes away, and that certain rarer content is archived forever, not subject to the changes of George Lucas or Disney editing out &quot;problematic&quot; content.",
