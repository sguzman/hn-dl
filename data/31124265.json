They could&#x27;ve done it closer to the beginning of the pandemic, when it wouldn&#x27;t have really affected the amount of subscribers, as people would&#x27;ve kept subscribed anyway - but to do it now was suicide. I know at least 5 people - personally - who quit Netflix after that.<p>The password sharing thing is also huge, as due to the insanity of the fragmentation that the ludicrous number of streaming services has caused, a lot of friends and families cope by subscribing to one service apiece and sharing them among each other.<p>As soon as these little tricks stop working <i>and</i> it becomes more expensive, people will just drop it. It&#x27;s not like Netflix has actually worked on any value adds recently - tbh I feel their content offerings have gotten so poor recently it&#x27;s next on the chopping block for me, too.",
