  "text" : "I love steam.  And the revenues from steam allow valve to experiment and explore (and support my favorite esport Dota2).  The Valve Index and Steam Deck would not exist were it not for revenue from Steam. Not to mention Proton.  As long as they keep doing interesting things, and allow me to play the games I buy offline (which they do), I will continue to be a Steam fan.",
