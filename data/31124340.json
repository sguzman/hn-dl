  "text" : "That&#x27;s fair enough and I did not know that, and will certainly take into account when making future purchasing decisions, thank you.<p>But the bottom line is, it&#x27;s just not worth paying for digital content for me, merely by knowing the fact that it&#x27;s available for free. A file has no intrinsic value, why should I pay for it?<p>I&#x27;ll gladly pay for an experience, or service, such as a movie theatre or a streaming platform that does the work of delivering content to me. But there is so much free stuff out there, paying to download the latest Batman movie is simply not worth it.",
