  "text" : "@Stunting your perspective in this thread is very valuable, and the best thing that streaming has done, much better than old-school bundling and certainly better than piracy, is encourage a boom in interesting content, and I&#x27;m very glad you and the other workers in entertainment are getting paid.<p>But flogging the tired comparison between stealing physical objects and making illegal copies of content is a losing argument. Everyone instinctively knows it&#x27;s not the same thing. Just because an end user gains a benefit they didn&#x27;t pay for doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s theft. The owner still has the content and can sell it to as many paying customers as they like. Once the car is gone, it&#x27;s gone and unavailable to sell to someone else. Consider: what would the auto market look like if we had Star Trek-style replicators and could make copies of physical objects for pennies?  Let&#x27;s use bikes instead. If you had the ability to make cheap copies of a bike, would it be ethical to deny the use of a bike to a poor farmer who could use it to get goods to market and make their life better, when your marginal cost is near zero? Do the needs of the R&amp;D people who designed the bike override that consideration?<p>This is just as much of a problem for all the software creators on here as for the content creators, though the rise of SAAS has changed that somewhat. Content&#x27;s inherent non-scarcity is one of the best things that has ever happened to humanity, it just happens to break our pre-existing economic model and hurt the people who create it.  This is a fundamental shift in our economy that&#x27;s underway and we have been lurching around trying to solve it for decades now.  We need to solve it, but pretending that it&#x27;s the same as theft is just not going to get us to a solution.",
