Speaking in generalities and characterizing people&#x27;s work without evidence is too facile; you can go to other popular social media sites for that. Elsewhere in this thread, my gentle prodding has led to discussion of some actual shows and scenes that people are thinking of, and it&#x27;s led to much more interesting - and less heated - discussion.",
