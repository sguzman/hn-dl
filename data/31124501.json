  "text" : "Our use-cases must be vastly different. steam is actually one of the few applications my friends and i talk about as having good design.<p>I&#x27;ve been using steam for over a decade and have always enjoyed that it works the way i expect a computer application to work.  i can right-click on things to get to their properties and other options, i can point it to games i have installed that i didnt buy through steam and they appear next to my steam games in my library seamlessly<p>the store UI is.. not the most intuitive thing for me, but it seems consistent.  it is very rare that i am browsing steam store to begin with, though.  I am usually searching for a specific game directly, which i never have trouble finding if it&#x27;s in their collection. I also like that i can add any games im interested in to a wish list and they notify me when it&#x27;s on sale<p>i used to edit my settings in a config file in counterstrike, which required &quot;tampering&quot; with local files but in a way that ultimately resulted in compliant files.  Finding that file was an obscure path to navigate, ill give you that - but again the organization is still consistent.  all files for one game can be found in one folder with the games name on it.  you can manually delete that folder and effectively uninstall the game.  you can even do a custom reinstall by selectively deleting files from that folder and ask steam to replace the missing items and it will.  For example, to reinstall a game without losing your save files.<p>Not trying to invalidate your experience, but your comment caught me by surprise because your dislike seems to be well rationed and thought out - ie genuine - so i just found it interesting",
