Setting them up takes more time than they are worth.  I tried installing them.  Most would describe me as technically savvy, but I just gave up.<p>example issues. \nHere&#x27;s the quick start guide. \n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.servarr.com&#x2F;radarr&#x2F;quick-start-guide\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.servarr.com&#x2F;radarr&#x2F;quick-start-guide</a> \n1. Get stopped immediately at the indexer. No sane defaults there at all. No guidance either.<p>Plex doesn&#x27;t do 4k streaming to Apple TV, doesn&#x27;t do 4k to chromecast.<p>The movies you pirate frequently have technical problems, usually the sound is off.
