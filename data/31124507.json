  "text" : "I cancelled because itâ€™s not worth the time investment. Good shows are not only difficult to find, but Netflix will release a season or two and unreasonably no longer continue on, without closing out the story. They try to cater to a mass audience and use a large net, but then due to capital costs or whatever reasons, they force their customer to feel stupid for getting invested into a show in the first place.<p>I miss the days where I could binge watch a series on release date. Now all the streaming services also seem to rate limit each episode to once a week.<p>All the qualities that drew me into streaming have slowly faded away.",
