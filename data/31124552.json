  "text" : "I got a $25 Fire TV Stick and plugged it into the back of my TV. I push 1 button and everything powers on and Netflix, Hulu, or Disney+ launch automatically. Any other service is a couple button presses away. All in 4k. (Well Hulu is upscaled)<p>I never have to leave my sofa. I don&#x27;t have to dick around with plugging and unplugging my PC. No keyboards to manage. No OS or software to keep updated.<p>Your solution is easier than some other options but I&#x27;ll stick with mine.",
