I really don&#x27;t want to pick option 2 because I empathize with people like you, who would be affected by that. For the moment, I&#x27;m picking option 3.<p>However, if you really want to &quot;educate consumers&quot;, you might be more successful if you change your tone so it doesn&#x27;t sound like aggressive victim-blaming. People like you and people like me are being screwed by a third group.",
