  "text" : "I have a friend who pays $15 a month for a dedicated seedbox, with 1-click install of a browser-based torrent app + plex. He set up plex to use the remote torrent folder, then anything he downloads gets immediately listed on plex, streamable anywhere, supports chromecast, etc. Pretty cool and a _little_ harder than using a proper paid streaming site, but not a different order of magnitude. Hardest part is finding the seedbox company and also tracking down the right torrent for the show (the choices can be overwhelming).",
