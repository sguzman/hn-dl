I don&#x27;t think that Disney allows to purchase it individually, but I can only guess, because in the sticks where I live (EU country), Disney+ isn&#x27;t even available.<p>That reminds me, what do you think about geoblocking these services? If one has a choice: buy the content, buy VPN and break the copyright by watching it in unsupported country or just break the copyright by pirating it outright, what should one do?",
