  "text" : "I agree.<p>- I recently realized I had only turned on my TV just about 4 - 5 times in about 6 months and yet I was paying close to $140 per month, so I downgraded my cable subscription to the minimal (combined cable &amp; internet is cheaper than only internet).<p>- Also realized I rarely watched Netflix (hadn&#x27;t watched in months) cos I no longer found shows that I liked and I was paying $15.49 per month. And then I saw HBO Max was $9.99 a month. So I canceled Netflix and signed on to HBO Max. There&#x27;s also the psychological part that HBO Max allows me to pay for the whole year upfront (Netflix doesn&#x27;t) so I can close my eyes and just pay them $100 and be done with it.<p>- I also realized I rarely have time to watch long form content except for weekends. This is one advantage that Amazon Prime has - apart from it being &#x27;free&#x27; to me since I already paid for prime, I can rent movies for $2.99 for those few times that I need to be &#x27;entertained&#x27;. Maybe I spend $6 in one month and $0 in others. It&#x27;s still better than $15.49 (or $140) without watching at all.<p>- It&#x27;s possible that lots of people have a variation of these reasons. I understand that Netflix had to raise their prices given how much they were spending on content. It looks to me like they &#x27;overspent&#x27; on content without taking into consideration that they would have to recoup the cost from increased subscription fees and this might not be palatable to their members given that there are now multiple alternatives",
