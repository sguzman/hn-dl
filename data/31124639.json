  "text" : "I grew up in the &#x27;80s and it was there then, too. Some example episodes from &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes,&quot; a show about a white industrial magnate who adopts a couple of Black orphans:<p>* A social worker investigates the boys&#x27; home life and tells Mr. Drummond that she believes black children belong in black households.<p>* Mr. Drummond scolds Arnold for secretly recording other people&#x27;s conversations. Arnold disobeys him and records Kimberly&#x27;s boyfriend Roger making racist comments about Willis to his sister.<p>* Arnold&#x27;s poor dental checkup has Drummond suspecting that the easy availability of junk food from vending machines at school is to blame. But when Drummond begins a campaign to replace the hot dogs, cookies, potato chips and soft drinks with more healthy foods, Arnold&#x27;s friends try to convince him to get his father to reconsider.<p>* Arnold&#x27;s joy of being transferred to an all-white school (and riding a bus to get there) is shaken to its very core when a racist busing opponent calls the Drummond household warning the pro-busing family patriarch not to send his black children to the new school, or else.<p>* When it is learned that Drummond&#x27;s upcoming construction project may be located on top of an ancient Indian burial ground, he faces protest from a Native American who threatens to go on a hunger strike if the land is built on. Arnold and Willis follow suit by going on a hunger strike of their own.<p>--<p>And of course, we mustn&#x27;t forget &quot;All in the Family&quot; from the 1970s; pretty much every episode was about politics in some way.",
