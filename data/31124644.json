  "text" : "The biggest problem Netflix has is content. When it first came out, it enjoyed a near monopoly and had access to content from every single major network. But as networks have started to roll out their own subscription services, Netflix is suddenly finding itself in a position where it lacks content. It has tried to become a content machine, but hasnâ€™t been very successful at it. Netflix is a tech company and not a media company, and as streaming tech becomes commonplace, Netflix is losing its edge.",
