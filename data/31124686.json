  "text" : "How you worded that sounds reminiscent of mafia &quot;protection&quot;. I assume that wasn&#x27;t your intention, but that&#x27;s how it read for me.<p>It seems to me like piracy of shows is tangential to whatever the root of the issue is. Folk are becoming disenchanted with streaming services. Whether they pirate or just stop watching instead, the services have clearly changed in ways that make them less valuable to consumers. Unless somebody figures that out, it&#x27;s not going to improve. I doubt DRM is the answer, although a combination of higher prices and consolidated content might be. Folk would pay more for Netflix if it was still a &quot;monopoly&quot; with all the popular shows.<p>I think accusing folk of stealing money out of your pocket for downloading a video is quite hyperbolic and isn&#x27;t winning you any arguments. You&#x27;re trying to make it a moral issue, but it isn&#x27;t really a moral issue, and nobody outside of the industry cares. You could claim that it&#x27;s disrespectful to you as a participating member of society, and it probably is, but yelling at people to respect you more doesn&#x27;t work, and has the opposite effect.<p>I think your point, though, is that it&#x27;s a tragedy of the commons situation. The industry works as a whole because people are willing to pay a premium in exchange for entertainment. If people don&#x27;t pay, then there&#x27;s no incentive to produce. If folk value new entertainment, they need to support the industry that produces it.",
