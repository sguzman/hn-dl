  "text" : "I have a similar experience with respect to watching foreign produced content. It&#x27;s interesting because they present different approaches to the shows and even if they&#x27;re using entertainment tropes they can be different enough because they&#x27;re tropes of that nation.<p>But once I watched a few, Netflix filled my entire recommendation catalog with almost all e.g. Turkish and Korean shows. Pretty annoying as it&#x27;s like ordering an ice cream dessert, then the only thing the menu ever shows is all ice cream desserts. It makes me think part of people feeling it&#x27;s all the same is that the recommendation optimization is overbearing in shoveling too much of more of the same recent history vs presenting a mix of recommendation and discovery.",
