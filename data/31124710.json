  "text" : "I have been a Netflix customer for 5+ years, and I&#x27;ve switched services to Disney+ for two reasons:<p>- Netflix with 4K and 4 streaming devices costs 17.99€ here ($19.50), while Disney+ only costs €8.99 with the same features.<p>- Netflix made and continues to make good content, but since major producers have been removing their content from Netflix and into their own services, Netflix here almost survives on old local shows and new in-house content. Feels like there&#x27;s almost nothing new to watch. I have rewatched Gilmore Girls 4 times. Disney+ gets you Marvel, Disney, Pixar, FOX, NatGeo, StarWars, Star (lots of ABC content)<p>-Netflix decided to crackdown on password-sharing: my brother moved away some months ago and has been using our Netflix account, and we don&#x27;t want him to pay Netflix for himself.<p>-There have been some rumors of ads on the platform to boost revenue. Hell to the no.",
