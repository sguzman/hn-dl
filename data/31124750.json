  "text" : "No, it&#x27;s not. If I pay for a movie, but I then download it from The Pirate Bay, it&#x27;s still piracy, but nobody loses anything.<p>I recently went over my media collection and did some conservative guesstimation of my spending over the last 20 years. I&#x27;ve paid over 6 figures to consume various sorts of media.<p>I have absolutely zero moral or ethical qualms with downloading and&#x2F;or pirating content I&#x27;ve already paid for. I don&#x27;t give a flying fuck if the copyright holder doesn&#x27;t like the means by which I get the content. The studios and copyright lobby and mafiaa are not good faith operators.<p>Piracy is not theft. Sometimes it&#x27;s ethical and justified.<p>I <i>WANT</i> to pay. I want to give a streaming service money to curate, deliver, and maintain a library of high quality content. The industry doesn&#x27;t want that to be possible, because it interferes with the bad-faith rentseeking games played with royalties and residuals. I&#x27;m done playing pretend, and will happily Pirate even new content I haven&#x27;t paid for.<p>I will pay when there&#x27;s the opportunity for good faith commerce. I&#x27;ll buy discs and files directly where possible.",
