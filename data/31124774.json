(Moral ads are theoretically possible, but in practice I almost never see ads which have the purpose of informing rather than emotionally manipulating.

If they cross that line, I&#x27;ll no longer be &quot;supporting a company bringing a moral perspective on content delivery&quot; and turn off autorenew: just pick up a month or two a year.",
