  "text" : "I, and nobody I know, has pirated games or music since Steam blew up about 12-15 years ago and Spotify&#x2F;RDIO and similar blew up about 10 years ago.<p>There was about a decade when Netflix went full in on online streaming and was offering a fantastic service for a reasonable price with a far superior experience to piracy.  That is no longer the case, and the unbundling to now a dozen+ of subscriptions is driving pretty much all my techie friends back to movie&#x2F;tv piracy.  I personally don&#x27;t really watch much TV and might watch one or two movies a year, so I&#x27;ll just not watch anything.  I&#x27;ve already cancelled my Netflix subscription about a year ago, and I prefer playing video games and reading books anyway.<p>Until your industry can offer a product experience that is superior to piracy, people are going to pirate.  The games and music industries have largely solved this problem.  When will yours?",
