  "text" : "Not really. I am saying there is an artificial corporate element of inserting political narratives into much of the programming.  Authentic pieces where writers just create a good story typically reverberate better with audiences .. despite the writers political opinions whether they lean left or right.<p>The opposite is true.  If a writer feels or is outwardly coerced that he&#x2F;she must include certain characters, topics, behaviors.... this comes off an not genuine, propagandized, or even corporate commercially.  My personal opinion is much of the Netflix original content falls into this later category.",
