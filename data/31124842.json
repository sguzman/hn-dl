  "text" : "I haven&#x27;t canceled yet but am considering it. They have a few problems for me -<p>They don&#x27;t make it easy to discover content. They still have quite a lot of good original content that isn&#x27;t promoted and a slew of third party things that aren&#x27;t promoted or discoverable at all unless they happen to make the trending list<p>The majority of their original, promoted content is watered down crap designed for mass appeal.<p>For TV shows, when they do produce something of quality they often dump it if it doesn&#x27;t find an audience immediately or it doesn&#x27;t drive &quot;new subscribers&quot;. Leaving a bunch of stories half told doesn&#x27;t give me the confidence that it&#x27;s worth the investment to start on their new content. This is especially problematic because it is a vicious cycle where since they aggressively cancel stuff that isn&#x27;t performing, people don&#x27;t invest their time in new stuff because of the expectation it gets canceled, means more new stuff underperforms, leading to more cancelations, and further eroding the trust of viewers. It&#x27;s also negatively impacted by poor discoverability.<p>Their UI is seemingly optimized to shove their latest broad appeal stuff in my face and seems to deliberately make it hard to find anything else.",
