  "text" : "Plex is nice! I run a Server for Family and Friends, it works great, but I’m an IT GUY and it’s a Hobby.<p>For the most people it’s too much struggle to run this, especially when plex has the default settings of „transcode everything to 2mbit if the server is not at home“.<p>I have multiple subscriptions, but most players suck (I look at you Amazon Prime). Plex is a way better experience.<p>Oh I use a Nvidia Shield as Client. It’s awesome!",
