  "text" : "The real reasons are almost certainly economic and structural, and not a result of silly culture war wedge issues.<p>1) Netflix has much more streaming competition now.<p>2) Availability of good content has gone down as networks reserve it for their own new platforms, and as production was halted by covid.<p>3) Greater scarcity gives studios pricing power to increase Netflix&#x27;s cost to acquire the few good shows available.<p>4) Netflix tried to counter (2) and (3) by making their own shows, but a lot of it is trash.<p>5) Netflix raised customer prices aggressively, while there&#x27;s not much on their platform to justify the higher prices.<p>6) Customers are increasingly savvy about binge-watching what good shows there are on one platform, then cancelling it and rotating through other platforms.<p>7) Loyalty is for suckers. Churn, baby, churn.",
