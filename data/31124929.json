  "text" : "&gt; Using a pirate streaming service such as stremio is literally no more difficult than Netflix.<p>Nope. Just tried it. Literally not. It gives me the option to play movies, but nope. Can only play trailers.<p>There are addons, but they seem to use Torrent. I have no interest in streaming up to other people and redistributing the data. Is that set up automatically, or does it reuse my internet connection without informing me?<p>Also, with Netflix, I don&#x27;t have to worry about copyright issues. Does streamio make that as easy?<p>None of this sounds literally as easy.<p>And again, literally cannot play a movie I can easily play on Netflix.",
