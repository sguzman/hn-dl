  "text" : "&gt; There&#x27;s also the psychological part that HBO Max allows me to pay for the whole year upfront (Netflix doesn&#x27;t) so I can close my eyes and just pay them $100 and be done with it.<p>Interesting. My behavior has been that when someone recommends a show on Netflix and I decide I want to watch it it subscribe and cancel which means I pay for 1 month. I watch the show. I&#x27;ve tried browsing for others but hate browsing on Netflix. I&#x27;m happy that &quot;I&#x27;m done with it&quot; immediately and that I&#x27;m not billed anymore. Netflix makes it super easy to start again, and to cancel and also like that having it cancelled provides a tiny hurdle against binging random stuff.",
