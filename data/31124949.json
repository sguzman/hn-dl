  "text" : "I agree that promises from these companies mean nothing.. but how much of a problem is this in todays gaming market though really?<p>many new games are free and rely on in-game transactions tied to an account outside of steam<p>There are no restrictions on the games I bought through steam that actually get in the way of me playing them - and there are a lot of conveniences offered like having access to my entire library on any machine with steam installed, or playing the games installed on my machine pretty much indefinitely offline.  And being able to verify my game files and have them automatically fixed &#x2F; updated<p>The games i bought a long time ago and still play have more than earned the money i spent on them anyway.  if steam dies and i need to buy them again, i will and i will be happy to. if i cant find them anywhere because the games  themselves died, ill make an image of my PC before upgrading it or uninstalling them and play them offline in a VM<p>there might be an itch here or there i cant scratch for whatever reason, but i can always buy a new game inspired by the same genre which is usually more fun than trying to recreate a nostalgic feeling anyway",
