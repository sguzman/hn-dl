  "text" : "Netflix stuff has just come to feel so...sanitary.  It&#x27;s like they have an enforced style of wardrobe and cinematography or something.  It all just feels kindof the same.<p>Even shows like Ozark have this very &quot;netflixy&quot; feel to them.<p>The sense I got when Netflix started going original content was that it was the place for creatives to go and flex their muscles.  They could do really weird stuff like Sense8 or The OA (both absolutely <i>top</i> tier stories in my opinion).<p>But now, I have come to expect that no shows will ever go anywhere (story wise) that is interesting.  No boundries will be pushed, just bland kindof all the same background stuff.  It&#x27;s too bad, because some of the early stuff was really cool.",
