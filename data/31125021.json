  "text" : "I generally avoid any service that even has an ad-supported tier because in my experience it starts out as &quot;ads are to subsidize the cost for people who can&#x27;t afford or don&#x27;t want to pay for the premium service.&quot; Then it becomes, &quot;We&#x27;re contractually obligated to have ads in certain shows regardless of which tier the viewer is, but they won&#x27;t show up in others, and they&#x27;ll be short and unobtrusive.&quot; Then it&#x27;s &quot;We&#x27;re keeping rates low by having ads in all show, but they&#x27;re ads that are relevant and very short, and only at the beginning and&#x2F;or end of the show.&quot; Then it becomes &quot;We&#x27;re removing the premium tier because not enough people signed up for it. Also the ads are going to be longer and more intrusive now.&quot; Forget it. I can just skip the whole thing and lose nothing. If you even have an ad-supported tier, I&#x27;m out.",
