If someone took a photo of something I painted, and started making copies and <i>selling</i> them, yea I&#x27;d be pissed. That&#x27;s what copyright law should be used to protect against.<p>If someone took a photo of my painting for their personal use, instead of buying one of the photos of my painting that I sell myself, I&#x27;d reconsider whether my business model of selling photos is the right one.",
