Whenever a game I&#x27;m interested in comes out, I first go to the AppStore to see if it&#x27;s available there, then to the developer&#x27;s web site, and only as a last resort to Steam. The UX is some of the worst I have to use in a given week. It constantly shows me games that don&#x27;t run on any system I&#x27;ve ever used (Windows exclusives, but I&#x27;ve never used a Windows machine since I signed up for Steam, for example). It&#x27;s just awful all around.",
