  "text" : "On bad quarter for subscription losses-- driven by dropping out of the Russian marked-- (they&#x27;d be up 500k subscribers if not for that) and people are jumping on the &quot;Netflix is doomed&quot; bandwagon.<p>That seems very premature to me. Subscription growth has slowed and they may still lose some more, but saying the bottom is dropping out is hyperbole at best &amp; clickbait at worst. (though why not both?). They&#x27;re facing more competition, and coming out of COVID lockdowns probably means people aren&#x27;t home as much to binge watch shows. Not enough to doom them unless they start hitting a bunch of own goals.",
