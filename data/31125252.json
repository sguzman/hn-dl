  "text" : "Hard lesson learned from years of trying to &quot;educate&quot; people on things that matter to me: you&#x27;re going about it all wrong. I&#x27;ve seen your posts all through this thread. All you&#x27;ve done is beat people over the head with your perspective and berate them for not agreeing with you.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is what you mean to do. I think you really care about this! Lay down your sword and <i>listen</i>. Hear what people are saying in response. Let their responses inform and refine your advocacy. You can&#x27;t stroll in broadcasting an ideological, self-interested position and expect people to react well.",
