  "text" : "What if 6 people watch it for one purchase?  Does it become theft then?<p>How about a college dorm hosting a movie night?  Maybe theft?<p>What if a million people watch it for one purchase?  I know you think that&#x27;s theft, but I&#x27;m not sure where you&#x27;d draw the line.<p>I think the reality is that 90% of the population won&#x27;t pirate because it&#x27;s too much effort and legally ambiguous.  If your content becomes popular through piracy, you will absolutely reap the rewards of good content creation.<p>If a billion people pirated your content because it was <i>that good</i>, you&#x27;d have absolutely no problem monetizing.  You&#x27;d be a household name.  When Disney loses their copyright on the Mouse, they&#x27;re still going to be a huge company capable of monetizing all things Mickey.<p>If we get back to a state where everyone is pirating because the content services suck, then you need to petition your content distributors to lower friction and provide an experience worth paying for, but we&#x27;re nowhere near that.<p>Gabe does it with Steam.  I used to almost exclusively pirate games, and now I almost exclusively buy them, because Steam has value adds (achievements, friends, online play, tournaments, workshop content, etc).<p>Also, you have to understand that many people who have large collections of pirate content see themselves more as archivists than viewers.  I&#x27;d guess most pirated content never even gets consumed, just downloaded for a &quot;later&quot; that never comes.",
