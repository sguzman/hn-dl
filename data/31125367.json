  "text" : "&gt; I&#x27;ve tried browsing for others but hate browsing on Netflix.<p>Is this Netflix or do you hate browsing on other streaming services as well?<p>Regarding UI IMO Netflix is still top. Disney+ is somewhat close in handling but noticeably slower and you notice its focus on movies. Series are not as easily navigatable as on Netflix.<p>Amazon Prime is abysmal. They don&#x27;t even group different seasons of a series together. Here in Switzerland, it&#x27;s even worse, I get a mix of French and German stuff recommended.",
