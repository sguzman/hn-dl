You are not.<p>You have an option to pay for the service as offered, steal it, or move on.<p>Entertainment abounds in our society and is readily available at little to no cost all around you via local theater, open mic nights, libraries, etc.<p>The connivence  of having that entertainment pumped directly on demand to your home is a luxury that has a certain value to it.<p>Currently that luxury is available via paying for the service or stealing it. The theft is relatively low risk, even by hilariously paying for a services that help hide your theft. That&#x27;s the number one reason these services are being stolen.",
