  "text" : "<i>&gt;GabeN is not correct. Piracy is a money problem.</i><p>GabeN is partially correct: It&#x27;s a money &amp; service problem. It&#x27;s money for some, service for others, sometimes a bit of both. During college I had no money, so the issue for me was money. Once I got a job after college it was service: I didn&#x27;t want to drive to music store &amp; hope they had the CD in stock that I was looking for, not when I could definitely get it in 5 minutes online. Similar issue for videogames: I didn&#x27;t want to spend $30-$60 for a game I couldn&#x27;t return, when my computer might choke on it &amp; not run or if half an hour in I realized it was crap. On top of which I might have to drive around to half a dozen stores to find a copy. That was a mixture of service &amp; money.<p>These days it&#x27;s faster for me to pay $1 for a song than pirate it, and I can instantly buy, download, and return a game in an hour if it either doesn&#x27;t run or I hate it immediately.<p>Free is enticing, but so is convenience &amp; instant gratification.",
