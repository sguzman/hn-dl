  "text" : "Netflix feels like a case of trying to “A&#x2F;B testing as substitution for a strategy”<p>Being overly focused on engagement optimizes what’s easy to measure. It doesn’t always optimize what’s important. In the case of Netflix what’s important is brand strength and month over month subscriber retention. Engagement optimization leads to click-baity crappy reality TV instead of shows that actually drive retention<p>Meanwhile other services (notably Apple TV+) simply focuses on quality over quantity and starting to do rather well.",
