  "text" : "We have publicly available stats for their competitors. (And actually we do &quot;know&quot; the reason for this quarter&#x27;s loss for Netflix: shutting down and losing 700K subs in Russia.)<p>Is Netflix more &quot;woke&quot; or &quot;less scifi&quot; or &quot;prone to pirating&quot; or &quot;annoying about UI and recommendations&quot; than Disney+ or HBO Max? (Ok, HBO Max has had a lot of cinema-quality sci-fi and similar genre content land recently, so maybe on that one?)<p>Those services are gaining subscribers faster so any backlash seems less likely, compared to &quot;there is a lot more serious competition than their used to be, Netflix costs the most, and has a far less proven content model.&quot;<p>Netflix is increasingly only worth it for their originals, and now those are head to head against Disney and HBO+Warner cinema originals.",
