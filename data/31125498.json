  "text" : "Netflix is kind of stuck. They don&#x27;t have expansion revenue and therefore growth prospects are limited to increasing subscriptions against now a very competitive, and almost commoditized market.<p>The writing was on the wall that Disney+, HBO Max, etc would be attacking them and taking away customers.<p>Those legacy businesses have other sources of revenue and streaming is their future. They have the means to keep their prices low for many years to fuel growth.<p>Not sure what Netflix can do to continue growing. Then again, they managed to switch from DVD to streaming years ago. It was rough, they made mistakes but overcame them. Looking forward to see what they do.",
