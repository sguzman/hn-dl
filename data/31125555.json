  "text" : "I can tell you why i cancelled my subscription. Everytime i would access Netflix from another device, they would reset my password and i couldn&#x27;t create a new one without contacting customer service. They basically kicked me out. When i said i don&#x27;t want to go through this process for the third time, and since your algorithms kicked me out, i want my money back, at least whatever is left of my subscription. They said no, i either go through the manual process with them to reset my password, or my subscription will automatically renew (because i can&#x27;t even log in to cancel it). Thankfully they were very happy to cancel my subscription on my behalf.",
