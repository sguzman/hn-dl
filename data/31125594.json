  "text" : "I went looking for a la carte options for all the Star Treks. They really want almost $50 per season for DS9, a show that premiered almost 30 years ago. There&#x27;s just no reasonable way to justify that but greed. I can&#x27;t believe people like Stunting actually see much of that ~$50, and I think they&#x27;re here fighting over people not giving them their scraps when there&#x27;s no guarantee people are making a choice between paying $50, paying $10 to Paramount, or downloading a copy (&quot;pirating&quot; IP is a made up concept no one uses outside the world of RIAA, MPAA, and similar).",
