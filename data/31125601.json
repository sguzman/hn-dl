Copyright infringement is <i>not</i> theft, and must be treated differently, because what you gain, nobody has lost; the supply is infinite.<p>If you accuse someone of stealing the income, but they haven&#x27;t gotten any money out of it, how does that make sense? What you&#x27;re describing is a <i>missed opportunity</i> for a sale; had someone &#x27;stolen&#x27; nothing and simply passed the product by, you would still not have made that sale and nothing would have changed.",
