It feels to me a little bit like the N=1 vs N=0 problem of theism - I&#x27;m simply an atheist to one more god than you are.  Similarly, I simply don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s theft to one more person in that context than you might (of course, here I&#x27;m assuming you don&#x27;t think all those people are stealing).",
