Even if they don&#x27;t watch it themselves, they will provide it free of charge or even for a personal fee I will never see to someone else.<p>The concept that Pirates wouldn&#x27;t have paid for it anyway is valid. Part of my problem with piracy is that so much bullshit gets consumed that without stealing, those things would be much less part of pop culture and we&#x27;d have a lot better stuff to entertain us.<p>However for definition sakes. Taking a service that you wouldn&#x27;t have consumed by paying and using it for free is stealing.",
