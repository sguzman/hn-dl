  "text" : "The reason I cancelled was a combination of not being particularly interested in most of the content (I liked Bridgerton though) and the fact that while they were boasting record profits, they hiked their price up. I remember back when their streaming service was new it seemed like they had every movie under the sun (or at least a lot more than they do now) but since every studio has decided to have their own streaming service, it&#x27;s mostly Netfilx&#x27;s own movies&#x2F;shows. Some are good but they miss way more than they hit.<p>On top of that, raising the price in the same month that they announce record profits left a really bad taste in my mouth. I know they&#x27;re a business, and businesses love to chase infinite growth, but that doesn&#x27;t mean I have to like it or give them my money.<p>The best streaming service for my particular usecase, which is primarily watching wide release movies, has been hbo max&#x2F;go&#x2F;whateverthey&#x27;recallingitthisweek. They get most of the wide release movies I&#x27;m interested in, and for the older weirder niche stuff that they don&#x27;t get, I just buy the dvd&#x2F;blu-ray and throw it on plex.",
