  "text" : "I would gladly pay for a service I am currently getting through piracy if there was a legal way to have it though. Availability of all content, no geoblocking (I live in a country where Disney+ and HBO Max is not available but I do pay for Prime and Netflix). For me if there was a way to have what I&#x27;m getting in a legal way I&#x27;d go for it but it is not an option. What I&#x27;m getting at is that its not a matter of money&#x2F;pricing its also a matter of convenience, availability and not having to track 4+ subscriptions and apps when you can watch it all under a single platform.",
