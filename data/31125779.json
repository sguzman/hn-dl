  "text" : "I don&#x27;t understand how anyone can say the netflix UI is anything other than trash.<p>Part of people&#x27;s problem with netflix is that it shows them maybe 100 different shows out of the couple thousand they have at any given time, for the rest you basically have to use a 3rd party to discover them. Sure its prettier than it was back when they put everything in a giant tree&#x2F;list, but now its a dozen or so vertical categories with 20 or so horizontal items and it doesn&#x27;t even bother to deduplicate shows out of multiple similar rows.<p>The best netflixy way for me to discover new shows is to log into my wife&#x27;s profile where she has a 100 different romance&#x2F;etc movies. Otherwise &quot;whats-on-netflix.com&quot; for example does a better job than netflix itself, including showing a complete list of new additions, and removals, etc.",
