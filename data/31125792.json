  "text" : "Maybe by your lights.<p>It is a fact that gay marriage is an experiment, never before tried in human history.  We do not know how successful it will be in raising children to be healthy, productive human beings -- which is the chief social purpose of marriage.<p>Likewise the whole sexual revolution and the normalization of sex outside marriage is an experiment.<p>We do know that &quot;hetero&quot; relationships, and married ones in particular, can succeed enormously at producing children and raising them successfully.  Perhaps these various new arrangements will succeed just as well, and I expect enormous political pressure on evidence and analysis to support just that conclusion, but we will see.<p>Until time has told, the presumption that homosexual relationships are the same as heterosexual is a matter of conjecture and, well, politics.",
