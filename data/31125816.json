  "text" : "This is underrated.<p>I recall hearing a discussion on the extreme desire humans have to hear a story&#x27;s ending, even when they aren&#x27;t that interested in the story. There is simply a need to know how it ends. I&#x27;ve caught myself to often watching something I think is a waste of time but needing to know how it ends. This is as much of a weakness as the reciprocity rule.<p>Netflix burned me to many times on this. It&#x27;s bad taste to re-use the same story time &amp; time again to pump out tons of content. It&#x27;s unforgiveable to not finish the story though.",
