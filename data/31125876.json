  "text" : "Honestly I think a bit mistake Netflix makes which others don&#x27;t as much is reminding people they exist so damn frequently. The #1 rule of subscription services is to let people forget they are subscribed.<p>I&#x27;m also surprised Netflix doesn&#x27;t have a yearly bundle... that&#x27;s how Prime gets me, by the time I get charged for a year, it&#x27;s already too late. Less frequent bills means less chance for someone to reconsider their subscription.<p>But yes, the constant email they send me about things changing and the price increasing, every email is a chance for someone to realize they don&#x27;t use Netflix and would rather unsubscribe.",
