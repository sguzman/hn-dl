But Netflix seems to be worse than average and that&#x27;s an already low bar.<p>Things that rustle me... \n- recommending movies&#x2F;shows I&#x27;ve already watched.  There are very few shows I want to rewatch.\n- recommending trash reality shows.  I rarely watch them.\n- recommending too many shows that are in a foreign language. I will watch foreign shows, but most of my viewing it&#x27;s just background noise while I workout or something else where I can&#x27;t easily watch subtitles.\n- Auto-playing trailers. It&#x27;s annoying and loud.",
