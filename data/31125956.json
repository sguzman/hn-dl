  "text" : "&gt;There have been some rumors of ads on the platform to boost revenue. Hell to the no.<p>oh geez, that would be the death knell for netflix.  that was one of the big benefits they had over cable ten years ago when streaming was still new.  i cant imagine paying $18 a month and still being forced to watch ads.<p>on a side note, im extremely pissed at paramount because their &quot;ad-free&quot; plan was updated to force viewers to watch a 30 second spot at the beginning of every show.  if star trek strange new worlds doesnt turn out to be a million times better than picard and discovery i just might cancel because im so pissed i have to watch ads on the premium plan.",
