I used to spend at least 10 hours a month managing my own Plex&#x2F;Emby, the money is well spent to me.<p>Also, buy an nvidia shield tv pro. It plays everything directly with no transcode, and handles all subtitles effortlessly without triggering a transcode.<p>I tried roku, amazon cube, apple tv, everything - the shield is the best still despite it&#x27;s age. It&#x27;s flawless.",
