I think that physically purchased goods should be free from any sort of &quot;DRM.&quot; and is not stealing.<p>The difference is one party at a time, i.e. household, library patron, etc, can enjoy the entertainment service.<p>When you pirate it, The original owner of the dvd retains the service value as well as providing the service to others without any value being transferred to the workforce&#x2F;IP holders.<p>That&#x27;s the difference and I personally am all in for a mythical solution that  but still allows complete freedom of ownership while also stopping people from digitally reproducing assets and dispensing them exponentially.<p>I don&#x27;t believe it will ever happen tho :&#x2F;",
