  "text" : "There&#x27;s two (relevant) kinds of consumers here: Those who want access and those who want ownership.<p>Netflix was on a path to successfully serve the first kind, the only remaining problems being region locking and an incomplete catalog. Demand for piracy went down. Then the industry got greedy, made one of those remaining problems much, much worse, and now the demand for piracy is on the rise again.<p>The industry spends a lot of resources making life worse for the second kind, in a misguided attempt to both satisfy them and fully prevent the possibility of piracy. Instead they fail at both. The result is an increased demand for piracy.<p>&gt; You&#x27;re directly responsible for sucking the quality of life away from people who make your entertainment and reducing the desire to make things you enjoy. You&#x27;re going to end up with shows that are AI generated CGI sponsored by Mt. Dew and Chevy trucks.<p>So here&#x27;s the problem: The only way I can spend money to encourage the production of content I want is to buy a terrible, abusive product I don&#x27;t want. It only plays in 720p, it&#x27;s only available through a shitty app, it may disappear from the platform it&#x27;s on any time.<p>All of it is just a wrapper for content. Please sell me the content. Whatever file comes out at the end of the production process, sell it to me.<p>Instead I spend my money in other places. Streamers on Twitch want it. YouTubers want it. People on Patreon want it. Developers want it. Somehow they manage not to abuse the people willing to give them money.",
