  "text" : "Modern videostreaming is such a poison pill. Where the rights come and go arbitrarily. So Netflix decided they were going to do their own content because they couldn&#x27;t rely on production studios. Since they don&#x27;t have to pay royalties on their own content the streaming apps intentionally push the homegrown movies and obscure the slightly better 3rd party content. And it was not always like this. In their early streaming days the AAA titles (The Godfather, The Matrix, etc) were front and center. The recommendations engine was actually useful. And there were few competitors so AAA titles would stay on their platform for years.<p>I&#x27;ve been using their service since 00s when they were shipping DVDs. I barely recognize the same company even though they are wildly successful.",
