One entity has provided the fee for service (and afforded me 1&#x2F;100th of an avocado toast, thank you very much) and is not in their ownership to do as they like.<p>That they want to share it is their business, not mine. If it&#x27;s good, those friends will tell other friends and someone along the way will purchase it again, and I&#x27;ll be even closer to my mortgage busting avocado toast<p>The hypothetical argument against that is &quot;what if I get 100 friends, for 100 nights to watch it.&quot; Sure, hypothetically you could but then it&#x27;d be pretty expensive for you and added wear and tear on your home and a pretty big headache to deal with. THe only way to justify it would be to start charging, which at that point, would be stealing. So it always comes across as a thought problem, but I find it&#x27;s not a real problem.<p>I don&#x27;t mind if the town throws a movie festival once a month and plays my movie. I mind if they all get to go home with the luxory of having it on demand and the ability ot share it with everyone they know without providing the service fee requested.",
