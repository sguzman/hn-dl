  "text" : "&gt; Amazon Prime is abysmal. They don&#x27;t even group different seasons of a series together. Here in Switzerland, it&#x27;s even worse, I get a mix of French and German stuff recommended.<p>I haven&#x27;t noticed this in France. For a given series, there&#x27;s a &quot;season&quot; dropdown that has all the seasons, even some which may be unavailable.<p>However, I hate dubbed movies and series, and I hate that I can&#x27;t filter out those titles that, for some reason, only offer a French dubbed version.",
