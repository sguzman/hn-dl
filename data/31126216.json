I don&#x27;t watch Netflix much (poor catalog, maybe lack of discoverability), but I don&#x27;t notice $20 going away either and would keep the service if it provided much value at all. Cancelling had been on my list for years.<p>I finally cancelled when I realized that whenever I did go look at it to see what&#x27;s available it felt like there was more agenda pushing than entertainment, which itself made me check for content less often in the first place. Netflix won&#x27;t miss my money, I may be in a small minority. It may be they get more subscribers for their politics than they lose (I&#x27;m sure they think so).",
