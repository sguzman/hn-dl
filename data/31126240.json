  "text" : "Anecdotal evidence, but I hear similar complaints from friends, and I think that the &quot;netflixy&quot; feel is going to be the single biggest downfall for the company. Netflix requires all original content must be filmed with a true 4K UHD sensor, and because these productions are all using the same powerful digital camera, these shows are all filmed with cheap low lighting setups, since these powerful new cameras require a lot less light to capture a scene (think of the newer iphone cameras and how they perform much better in low light). Whereas older non-netflix shows filmed on different cameras with much more powerful stage lighting setups.<p>The result is that all these new netflix-produced shows like Ozarks all look super flat and similar. Most scenes are very poorly lit, which leads to a really poor experience when watching on a laptop or tablet. I don&#x27;t think all viewers are consciously realizing it, but I think this is why many people are getting &quot;bored&quot; of netflix shows.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fastcompany.com&#x2F;90653850&#x2F;why-netflix-movies-look-so-weird\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fastcompany.com&#x2F;90653850&#x2F;why-netflix-movies-look...</a>",
