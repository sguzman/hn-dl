  "text" : "I think there is some merit in piracy being a service problem. There are certainly a number of situations where I just seek out a less than legal solution because there is no legal way for me to buy some media. Be it language barriers, region locking, license expiation, censored&#x2F;rejected media, etc.<p>However, people professing this quote everywhere should note that it&#x27;s very hard to compete with &quot;free infinite media&quot; for those with the knowledge to pirate. So don&#x27;t be surprised if instead of catering to that crowd that they instead focus on people who can&#x27;t or don&#x27;t want to pirate. It&#x27;s a double edged sword. If I do pirate, I don&#x27;t pretend I do it in some effort to make the product better. I do it accepting the risk that they may never choose to cater to me.",
