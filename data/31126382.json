  "text" : "&gt; The group of people who are comfortable pirating media and find it &quot;easier&quot; than Netflix is at least an order of magnitude smaller than Netflix&#x27;s user base.<p>This view is very US-centric.<p>In most of the &quot;rest of the world&quot;, netflix either doesn&#x27;t exist or has a very very limited show list (even here, in a relatively developed EU country), and piracy literally is the only way to get a lot of the very popular shows.<p>And if you already pirate 3 of the 5 shows that you watch, why would you pay for the other 2, that are available on netflix, if you can just pirate those too?",
