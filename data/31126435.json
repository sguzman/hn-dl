I can&#x27;t retract my subscription dollars, because they won&#x27;t even offer me the subscription (which I mentioned in my comment).<p>Could you as an knowledgeable insider actually answer the part of my previous comment you conveniently skipped, that part about what is person supposed to do if the Disney doesn&#x27;t even offer the service in their country? And don&#x27;t say &quot;let Disney know&quot;, something actionable please.<p>&gt;But if you steal it because that&#x27;s just how you want to do things, you&#x27;re a thief.<p>1) it&#x27;s not theft, it&#x27;s digital &quot;piracy&quot;<p>2) And I didn&#x27;t say I pirate their stuff, the show was just an example. But I still feel discriminated on account of country I am from by them refusing to sell me their subscription service. And everyone knows that racism is worse than stealing.",
