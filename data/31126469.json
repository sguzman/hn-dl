  "text" : "I don&#x27;t hate it, but I&#x27;ll admit that the Valve worship is some of the most cultish I&#x27;ve seen in video games. To the point where I feel gamers work against their best interests whenever they see a &quot;threat&quot; to their beloved library not having every game in history under one launcher (nevermind that Steam users can add non-steam games to their virtual library). You&#x27;d think Youtube and even Spotify lately would show the dangers of lumping all your eggs in one basket.<p>But, I will also admit that I&#x27;m a bit biased against steam due to using PC&#x27;s for a lot of Visual Novels. And their VN submissions have always been a lottery of some sorts, to the confusion of readers and developers alike. Nothing worse than having an existing product on the store and then suddenly having a sequel to the product rejected, while the first product still sits on shelves.",
