  "text" : "&gt;The question here is: so what?<p>Well, the huge dicourse in consoles atm is digital and ownership. There were several scares over the years (some that went through, some that backpedeled) on storefronts closing down and no longer being able to buy older games as a result, in a market where retro gaming is being flooded by scalpers selling stuff at 20x markups. Console players are feeling uneasy with the advent of there being &quot;digital only&quot; variants sneaking back in, and cloud gaming is getting bigger each year.<p>Maybe this is just a cacophony of old fans not getting with the times, but it seems like a signifigant enough sentiment that &quot;so what&quot; seems overly dismissive.<p>&gt;And for minecraft being open source: who cares?<p>older minecraft players apparently. Granted, it hasn&#x27;t really stopped their creativity and servers, so in practice it doesn&#x27;t change much. But I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised in some microfose move years down the line angering that playerbase.<p>Again, an oddly dismissive take for something that has historically happened. It&#x27;s easy to say &quot;I don&#x27;t care it&#x27;s convinent&quot; until it isn&#x27;t.",
