  "text" : "Not a money problem. I have a Netflix subscription, and yet end up going to pirate websites more and more often these days. I&#x27;ll probably just cancel my Netflix subscription.<p>It&#x27;s so frustrating to see that 90%of the shows I want to see are unavailable on Netflix. Video streaming is just so fragmented right now. And they try to compensate with a bunch of low quality Netflix original shows.<p>Why can&#x27;t they just replicate what has been done in audio streaming? Spotify is what Netflix should have been. It&#x27;s been years I no longer need to pirate music.",
