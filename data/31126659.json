  "text" : "Since Netflix launched in India couple of years ago I&#x27;ve been a subscriber. The content is strictly average. Amazon Prime and Disney + Hotstar have significantly larger, relevant, and better content. Amazon Prime gets you free shipping as well so that&#x27;s there.<p>However, I don&#x27;t know to what extent Netflix are relying on India for growth. At INR 650&#x2F;month it&#x27;s definitely not cheap. Disney + Hotstar, at INR 1499&#x2F;year is, <i>five times</i> less expensive.",
