I get the links all on one platform.<p>I got that money. I paid for Netflix once but now I can&#x27;t remember the last show I watched made by them. Instead I&#x27;d have to pay for at least 3 other platforms to watch those few shows I watch throughout the year. Sometimes I&#x27;d even have to use a VPN to get it in the original language.<p>It only is a service problem for me.<p>(there is a bit revenge for their inability to provide a single platform in there too)",
