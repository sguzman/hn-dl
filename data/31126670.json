I&#x27;ve done my share of piracy when I lived in countries where that was the only viable way to get my hands on the information, art, or entertainment that was otherwise unavailable to the vast majority of people living there. And no, I&#x27;m not ashamed of it, and it doesn&#x27;t offend me if you decide to label me a thief or worse.<p>What I was trying to do is have a conversation with you about why people &quot;steal&quot; or whatever the correct word for this thing is. Just like there are reasons people steal in real life, there are reasons for this behavior, too. You can try to understand it, or you can keep throwing everyone in the same bin, slap a label on that bin, and feel morally superior.<p>One of those two will lead to improvement for everyone. One of those two is easy. I&#x27;ll leave it an exercise for you to figure out which one is which.",
