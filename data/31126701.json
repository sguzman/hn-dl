  "text" : "&gt;But white Christian&#x27;s negatively portraying the rest of the world for the better part of a century is not political? Dr. Fu Manchu, Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s<p>This is dishonest. Minorities were also portrayed positively in legacy media, and villains were also frequently portrayed by white males.<p>&gt;Why is it only political when another group is creating the content<p>In the past studios were creating content relevant to a predominantly (90%+) white audience. They were creating content which was largely in line with their target demographic culture.<p>This recent media instead is creating content to disrupt what it&#x27;s owners and managers see as a &quot;racist&quot; culture. That&#x27;s what makes it political. It&#x27;s less about money and more about deliberately changing culture in a hypocritical manner - fighting alleged racism with explicit racism. Breakfast at tiffanies was not about punching down on asians, but black feminist vikings is about sending a politicized message.",
