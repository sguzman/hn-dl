  "text" : "The Netflix decision that is causing me the most aggravation is that they are the only service I use that doesn&#x27;t integrate with the watch next bar on Apple TV. I forget that I&#x27;m watching something, especially if they are doing weekly episode drops, and then lose interest if I&#x27;ve forgotten what&#x27;s going on. Everybody else is able to add their new episode to that bar so I can work through my backlog, and even pop new seasons in there if I&#x27;ve watched the show in the past.<p>It feels like they&#x27;re making decisions to suit themselves rather than me and it winds me up considering they are the more expensive subscription.",
