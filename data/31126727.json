And those smaller parts of the world pirating isn&#x27;t a big loss. Similar to the video game industry in Japan; some games may get an overseas following, but if the domestic market is slacking, that studio may not get the chance to make a sequel for those overseas fans.<p>So back to the US-centric sentiment: American audiences don&#x27;t have the excuse 99% of the time of &quot;this content is region blocked in my country&quot;, so the sentiment here shifts to &quot;I don&#x27;t want to manage 4 streaming services&quot;.",
