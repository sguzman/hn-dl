  "text" : "I loved NFLX when they had a 4-CD plan. All the HBO shows from the golden age of TV 10 years ago .. I know that I cannot blame them for losing streaming rights. But I definitely can for pushing the government ideology in their original content. The last few seasons of Longmire is the last show for normal people I can remember NFLX to produce.<p>I&#x27;d have no problem paying for the kind of TV we had with Mad Men or Breaking Bad. I&#x27;m not aware of any streaming service of that kind.",
