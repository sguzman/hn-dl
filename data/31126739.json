  "text" : "&gt; Likewise the whole sexual revolution and the normalization of sex outside marriage is an experiment.<p>This seems extremely ahistorical. I&#x27;m pretty sure humans were having sex <i>exclusively</i> outside of marriage for most of the history of Homo Sapiens as a species.  Marriage, and especially exclusively-monogamous marriage, is a relatively recent invention.<p>&gt; We do not know how successful it will be in raising children to be healthy, productive human beings -- which is the chief social purpose of marriage.<p>We kind-of know though[1]:<p>&gt; To date, the consensus in the social science literature is clear: in the United States, children living with two same-sex parents fare, as well as children residing with two different-sex parents. Numerous credible and methodologically sound social science studies, including many drawing on nationally representative data, form the basis of this consensus. These studies reveal that children raised in same-sex parent families fare just, as well as children raised in different-sex parent families across a wide spectrum of child well-being measures: academic performance, cognitive development, social development, psychological health, early sexual activity, and substance abuse.<p>Families with same-sex parents are not a new thing in 2022, there&#x27;s been plenty of time to draw conclusions.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC4091994&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC4091994&#x2F;</a>",
