Start producing original stories. We don&#x27;t even need all that fancy and expensive CGI crap. Just start writing properly and in a creative way. Pay THOSE people more IF they deliver (though I&#x27;m not sure anymore if you really understand what&#x27;s missing here with all your sequels and remakes...). We&#x27;re not the audience you should cry to, go to those managers who messed up that market so piracy is coming back again.",
