  "text" : "I&#x27;m aware that Netflix offers a tiered plan structure, but it seems pretty lackluster to me.  Really the only differentiator between plans is the availability of HD or Ultra HD [1].  That isn&#x27;t much of a value proposition to a viewer like me, since I only watch Netflix on my laptop.  I&#x27;d be curious to see what other tiered models Netflix has considered, if any.<p>One would think there&#x27;s room for a Netflix equivalent of Amazon Prime, where you pay a yearly fee instead of a monthly fee (as the author mentions), for which you get a discount off the monthly rate for essentially &quot;buying in bulk&quot;, as well as early access to original content, and maybe even get access to content that non-Prime subscribers can&#x27;t access at all.<p>Netflix&#x27;s strategy contains several apparent contradictions that I&#x27;m unable to make sense of. For example, charging by the month seems to conflict with releasing an entire season of content at once.  If you&#x27;re going to charge per-month, then as the author mentioned, switching to a weekly-release model seems like the smart move, so you can squeeze more months out of a viewer who sees that content as &quot;appointment viewing&quot;.  If you&#x27;re going with a &quot;binge-release&quot; model, I would think you&#x27;d charge per-year instead.<p>Another contradiction- simultaneously raising subscription rates and cracking down on password sharing seem to conflict with each other.  The more you raise your prices, the more you incentivize people to share passwords.<p>1. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;help.netflix.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;node&#x2F;24926\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;help.netflix.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;node&#x2F;24926</a>",
