  "text" : "I don&#x27;t, actually.  I pay for a number of things that I feel deliver value.  I&#x27;ve bought movies and TV off of amazon video&#x2F;youtube.  I pay for some podcasts. I buy audiobooks off of Audible and eBooks from kindle (despite these being even more expensive and more convenient to pirate than movies&#x2F;TV). I&#x27;ve commissioned some graphic design stuff for personal use.  Though I&#x27;m personally not into sports, a friend of mine is super into the NFL and buys their online package (though he still has to pirate certain local games because...not enough people showed up to the stadium that day???).<p>As I&#x27;ve said in the thread, for me the alternative to movies&#x2F;TV isn&#x27;t piracy, it&#x27;s playing games or reading books, which I do pay for because the experiences of finding what I want, buying it, and consuming it is a superior experience to piracy.  If that ever changes across the entire media landscape and games&#x2F;books go the way of movies&#x2F;TV that may change.",
