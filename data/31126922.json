  "text" : "This has been amazing to watch unfold.<p>Netflix after canceling all of its best shows during a period when piracy has never been easier: &quot;Let&#x27;s start doing ads!&quot;<p>I wonder if anybody at Netflix has seen the UX of popular streaming apps like (now defunct I believe) terrarium and its successors. They&#x27;re easier to use, just as fast as Netflix, have much larger libraries, allow DRM-free downloads, ad-free, no algorithmic spam, etc. It is incredible that when faced with that as another consumer option they&#x27;ve gone for &quot;severely degrade user experience&quot; as the strategy.<p>At this point, some vulture private equity firm should just take them private and sell it for parts. Clearly they&#x27;ve spent far too much time being the biggest player and have completely disconnected from what their customers want.",
