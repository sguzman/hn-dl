  "text" : "I canceled because they were raising my subscription to $19.99 (I had the UHD subscription), and I really don&#x27;t watch it enough to make it worth $20&#x2F;month to me.<p>I still have Hulu, HBOMax and Disney, so in 6 months or so I&#x27;ll probably drop one of those and return to Netflix to look for new content before they delete my viewing history. I&#x27;ve been with Netflix since when they were DVD-only, so they have a lot of history on me.<p>I imagine that before long, the streaming providers will get tired of people rotating through and will require 1 year contracts.",
