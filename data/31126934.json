  "text" : "I guess it depends on how they react now, and who the price increase hits.<p>For now subscription loss is a one-off event, so it&#x27;s a bit early to call it a cycle. They project to lose subscribers this quarter as well, so it could be the start but I&#x27;d guess that a base price increase is at least a year in the future since they just bumped it up. If they do it sooner, that would be a key sign of the cycle you&#x27;re talking about.<p>They have hinted at a price increase for accounts that are sharing passwords. On the other hand they&#x27;ve also hinted at a cheaper ad-supported plan. If they go ahead with an increase for shared accounts that could get messy. There&#x27;s a lot of potential for angry customers here. Get it right and people will be frustrated at higher prices, maybe cancel, maybe share the cost, but probably not be outraged. Get it wrong and they&#x27;ve got a million or more customers essentially getting fined for sharing an account that they&#x27;re not actually sharing.<p>It will be interesting to follow along, I just think it&#x27;s too soon to project any particular path. They could pull it together (maybe?) or they could proceed to botch things up with customer-unfriendly punitive policies and lower quality content as they try to cut costs, and maybe two years from now we&#x27;ll be looking at a Disney(+) buy out at a steep discount. (more likely, at least the part about screwing things up. A buyout... I don&#x27;t know. Maybe just stagnation.)",
