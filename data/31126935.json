What is being asked is which programs for children&#x2F;kids are you arguing is politically motivated?<p>The only examples anyone has been able to produce are children shows that have homosexual characters in them. I am going to assume the best of intentions here, but it&#x27;s very hard not to find it appalling that many people would think that a show that has some gay characters in it is making a political statement or has a political agenda.",
