  "text" : "The state of media Apps in General is REALLY low. Paramount+ makes me turn on subtitles for EVERY episode and ignores the system settings, HBO Max&#x27;s app is a dumpster fire, Netflix doesn&#x27;t integrate with Apple TV or the algo driven listings are terrible, Hulu is a broken mess all around. In fact the only media app I enjoy using is Apple TV+&#x2F;TV.app.",
