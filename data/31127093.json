  "text" : "The only thing I pirate is movies &#x2F; tv shows ... and it&#x27;s extremely simple: because it&#x27;s not humanly possible to purchase them digitally.<p>Games: yes. Music: yes. Books: yes. Magazines: yes. What happened to tv and film? Where are you all?<p>Let&#x27;s say I want to purchase The Fifth Element and throw it on my plex server so I can watch it on vacation out of the country? How can I do that? The answer is simple: you cannot. So I pirate it. And enjoy watching it. If the industry WOULD provide me with some way to purchase The Fifth Element, get a high quality mkv or mp4 or whatever download of it, I would do it in an instant.",
