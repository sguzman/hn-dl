  "text" : "Netflix suggestions are not good. It takes a long time to find something decent to watch.<p>I have enjoyed Narcos, Tiger King, Stranger Things, Queen&#x27;s Gambit and others.<p>But there are so many bad shows, that are formulaic, unoriginal and overall, lame.<p>Then, I have nothing against noble causes such as social justice and such. But compare a good movie, such as Men of honor, or the Green Book, with the unoriginal content on Netflix. It is just not watchable.",
