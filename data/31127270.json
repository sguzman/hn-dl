Every other service&#x27;s UI makes it surprisingly difficult to find and watch the next episode of &quot;thing I&#x27;ve been watching every night for the past few weeks&quot;. Also the other services make it harder to pause&#x2F;resume&#x2F;fast-forward, let alone achieve &quot;advanced&quot; things like toggling subtitles.",
