  "text" : "The cost is part of the reasons those never really caught on, not just participation. The number of titles I (and I assume, most people) will watch enough to warrant paying $20 for is vanishingly small. Even $4 a rental is a hard bar to pass at this point with streaming competing.<p>$1-2 to rent though? I&#x27;d be all over that. Weirdly, that&#x27;s the cost to rent a physical disk at Redbox...but an on demand title anywhere is higher than that. Despite a streaming solution being cheaper to distribute, the fact it&#x27;s more convenient&#x2F;desirable, I guess, means it costs enough to price it outside of what I want to pay.<p>This feels like a really inefficient market.",
