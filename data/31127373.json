  "text" : "I pay for a handful of streaming services but that&#x27;s only because they&#x27;re decent for content discovery and ease of use. If there&#x27;s ever anything on there that I genuinely like I just pirate it (Arcane most recently) because the UX of having files that just work everywhere is so much better than the alternative. I would happily pay for unencumbered .mkv downloads if my recent buying trends wrt bandcamp .flacs are any indication.<p>The only way to stop me from pirating the media I like is if you actually let me buy the superior experience I can have as a pirate.<p>P.S. copyright and IP law in general need severe reform if we want to serve creatives and not executives",
