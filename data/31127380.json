Or if it’s not blame, it’s an attempt to shoehorn white supremacy as some prevailing ideology into every discussion.<p>Netflix does this constantly in their originals. They just can’t help themselves. And the usual suspects play coy about it when anyone complains. Go see a therapist, etc. for daring to notice the constant browbeating in Netflix programming and saying anything about it. If I watch tv, it’s to escape reality, including to not get proselytized to for thirty minutes of my life.",
