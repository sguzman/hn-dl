  "text" : "Proof by repeated assertion. The post you are replying to is an effective response to yours. Once more: It does not affect your ability to make a living if I consume a copy of your IP that I was not going to pay for in the first place. Watching it without paying for it does <i>not</i> take money from you, because you would still not have had that money if I had simply not watched it at all.<p>&gt; If you weren&#x27;t going to watch it, you wouldn&#x27;t.<p>This is flat out false and incredibly obviously so. You can easily see it just by cranking the numbers - if a video game is fun, but costs $500, do you really think that each person who pirates it is depriving the developer of $500? If some magical DRM scheme was implemented that could not be broken and guaranteed every person who played it, bought it, would everyone who pirated it in the previous hypothetical instead buy it for $500? No, they would ignore it, nobody would buy it, and the developer would have just as little money as they had before.<p>Pirating a piece of IP does <i>not</i> translate 1:1 into a lost sale as you keep variously asserting and acting like it does. It can even turn into a <i>gained</i> sale, in the case of video games or software, when people would not have bought it based on the promotional material but consider it worth buying after actually using it. You have a right to exclusivity on sales - selling pirated material is criminal - but you don&#x27;t have a right to actually make any sales if nobody wants to buy it.",
