  "text" : "I agree that piracy likely isn&#x27;t responsible for the larger immediate trend. But from the perspective of someone with a libre media setup, all these streaming&#x2F;DRM&#x2F;lockdown tribulations are like watching a storm from inside a warm house with a hot cup of cocoa. Especially on a technical forum where people should know better than to succumb to corporate ploys, its worth reminding everyone of that. And my comment did imply the end game for &quot;most people&quot; - technical friends&#x2F;family running seedboxes and sharing them up.<p>Current market wise, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the Netflix situation is people canceling their membership to spend that money on a different streaming service, and then swapping between friends to get the union of shows for a similar $&#x2F;month. This would explain both pushes of membership going down, plus them wanting to crack down on sharing.",
