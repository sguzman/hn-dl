  "text" : "Isn&#x27;t it because it differs so much from movie streaming? On major music streaming platforms you can find most of the popular music artists. I don&#x27;t have any numbers to back it, but my gut feeling tells me a-number-so-close-to-100 percent that it doesn&#x27;t even matter anymore it may not be actually 100. Movies? You can&#x27;t get Disney on Netflix, you can&#x27;t get Apple on HBO, you can&#x27;t get... you just can&#x27;t. Imagine having Metallica on Netflix, Madonna on Apple, Beatles on Sony and Silent Poets on Amazon.",
