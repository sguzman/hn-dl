  "text" : "I&#x27;ve been seeing people complain about the presence of PoC in many of these programs too, even though artificial diversity has been a staple of children&#x27;s programming since at least the &#x27;70s.<p>The fact that the inclusion of LGBT and&#x2F;or PoC in a children&#x27;s program is at all controversial tells me we still have a problem that needs to be addressed. If you really don&#x27;t like the idea of seeing a black or gay person on TV then you are the problem.<p>The sad thing is that a big majority of people complaining are people who are past child-rearing age and thus not even the target market for any of these shows.",
