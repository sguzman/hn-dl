  "text" : "YouTube has the best recommendation system in the world.<p>Of course it gets lots of complaints. But the amount of fantastic content it has consistently recommended for me, including even pretty small channels, is incredible.<p>A few points though:<p>1. I find YouTube to be good for general educational content. I don’t know if it’s as good for specific niches of entertainment.<p>2. It’s not just plug and play. You need to actively tell YouTube what you like and dislike, remove trash recommendations, and remove terrible videos from your watch history.<p>Do this, and you will be rewarded with a YouTube homepage full of hours upon hours of absolute gold. When I don’t know what to do, I open YouTube and just let it run. It’s awesome and life changing.",
