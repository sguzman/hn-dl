  "text" : "I think it&#x27;s not just canceling their &quot;best&quot; shows. They have lots of data on what people watch. Rather I&#x27;d say that when you cancel shows people <i>love</i> whether or not they have great ratings you&#x27;re creating a lot of brand damage that is not accounted for. I think this latest price increase really tipped that over the edge for plenty of people that weren&#x27;t getting much use from Netflix.<p>Price increases bring increased scrutiny on the value of the service compared to just hiding as a monthly $15 charge or so amongst a sea of subscriptions that products are sold as.<p>This is anecdotal but this is my experience. I used to love Netflix and though maybe they didn&#x27;t have the most shows they had shows I realllllly wanted to watch. Now? There is so little that I care about and the positive brand sentiment is gone. Great shows that I became attached to were canceled so regularly that I am truly not interested in investing time into their shows. Not all shows should go on forever but then you might as well commit to making everything a limited 2 season series and be honest about it.<p>I actually canceled Netflix and had not had it for a year before the pandemic (where I gave in) but I think many people in this economic environment are finding it easier to give up a TV subscription to a company that produces _mostly_, mediocrity.<p>It truly has been interesting to watch a giant brand so committed to their own internal analytics that they&#x27;ve lost so much of their brand reputation.",
