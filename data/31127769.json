  "text" : "That&#x27;s how Americans view Europe, yes. &quot;The user lives in Switzerland so they speak both&quot; :) in reality there&#x27;s German-speaking Swiss and French-speaking ones. In fact there&#x27;s even Italian-speaking ones but they don&#x27;t usually make the cut for services like this. The division is pretty much divided by region and heritage. They will technically speak both but will not prefer to. Also besides the languages there&#x27;s also a cultural difference. And Swiss-German is quite different from German&#x2F;Austrian German too but let&#x27;s not get into that.<p>Just bunching all the content &quot;because your country is .ch so you will like all of this stuff&quot; is such a typical American oversimplification.",
