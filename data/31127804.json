  "text" : "I still buy hard media (which makes me a Luddite apparently) because I consider it art and refuse to pay for digital media that is allegedly perpetual and then one day it goes missing because the wokes decided it should be memory holed.<p>One of many, many examples: \n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;screenrant.com&#x2F;its-always-sunny-blackface-episodes-missing-hulu-netflix&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;screenrant.com&#x2F;its-always-sunny-blackface-episodes-m...</a><p>Even things like iTunes Music Store which once claimed that all your past purchases are available for download from iCloud forever quietly became untrue when I discovered parts of my music library went missing. Come to find out the record company decided to pull licensing from Apple which made that media forever unavailable. So don&#x27;t forget your backups..... rule of thumb is that you can never trust any company with your media no matter how much bullshit they sell you.",
