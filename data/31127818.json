  "text" : "I did the same thing. I used to put a lot of effort into getting a perfect FLAC rip of everything I ever listened to, having them on my devices, or setting up streaming from a home server. I threw that shit out a long time ago, partly because I don&#x27;t listen to the garbage that I used to, and partly because I&#x27;ve got better things to fuss over now. The amount of time worrying about file integrity, backups, server being up (and updated)...sorry, 90â€° of it is music I&#x27;ll just get tired of soon. It wasn&#x27;t worth it. Spotify makes more sense for me.<p>Same with movies. As I&#x27;ve gotten older, I can name about a dozen movies I&#x27;d like to watch again. I can afford to buy the next &quot;highest quality release ever&quot; when the time comes.",
