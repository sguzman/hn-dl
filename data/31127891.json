  "text" : "I would do a whole lot more digital rentals if the prices weren&#x27;t so damn high. How is it that it can be significantly cheaper to rent the <i>physical disk</i> than to stream the movie once? How can I watch 20 hours of stuff on HBO in 4k for like $10 or $12 or whatever that runs now for a month, but a single 2-hour movie is $5?<p>It&#x27;d also help a lot if I didn&#x27;t need a different &quot;app&quot; for every store, with its own player UI. Learning how to use yet another designer&#x27;s cute &quot;experience&quot; just to do the same thing I used to do with a few buttons on the front of a VCR that were the same for every single movie, isn&#x27;t my idea of fun.",
