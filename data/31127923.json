  "text" : "A significant proportion of 90s trek fans who have seen the new series would agree its not worth it.<p>I pirate-streamed the first season of discovery due to its lack of availability on other platforms.  Felt like a 10 hour movie about a dystopian future with weak shallow characters rather than an episodic serial about the great people solving problems in a better society than we have today. Tried a few episodes of Picard and just didn&#x27;t get into it.  Neither were entertaining enough for my full attention, ended up watching on second monitor while playing a game.<p>I would feel like a schmuck if I paid CBS to subsidize this content: wasn&#x27;t what I want more of in the world.  There is no &quot;voting with your dollar&quot; in modern content delivery when you can&#x27;t get a refund when a show ends up being a waste of time.",
