  "text" : "Pirating has got a lot easier in recent years...<p>In my country (slovenia) there is a very good local torrent tracker + a lot of people use the few larger general torrent sites, and even &quot;grandpas&quot; can use them, if their &quot;computer-savy&quot; kid installs them a torrent client, and shows them where to search.<p>In you go further down the balkans, you can find full movies even on youtube, especially local ones (because youtube doesn&#x27;t remove them).  Not that long ago, you could also buy or rent pirated cds&#x2F;dvds literally from street vendors and &quot;movie clubs&quot; (think blockbuster, but smaller, more local and pirated).",
