  "text" : "It is a bit yes. I&#x27;ve not been to Switzerland but I know that in Belgium this is totally not done. Flemish speakers often despise French culture and vice versa. And have their own TV channels, shows, media personalities etc. I&#x27;m Dutch myself and am often viewed as Flemish by the French speakers when I try to speak French, and I can feel the hate (it&#x27;s quite uncomfortable so I don&#x27;t usually go to their parts).<p>Also, Netflix already shows so little in their overview, making half of them non-starters is really annoying. The world is not a cookie cutter duplicate of America with just some different language settings. There should be an option for local differences (not just this one but ones that exist in many countries). It&#x27;s just a total disregard of national and regional cultural differences too.<p>In fact I&#x27;m quite surprised the US has such a harmonised culture because they have huge differences too. I just can&#x27;t wrap my head around how a Silicon Valley hipster can be just as offended by half a boob on TV than a methodist Midwestern. Though only for the latter it&#x27;s an actual cultural and religious issue. The level of cultural harmonisation despite all the regional differences is something that&#x27;s pretty unique in the US I believe. I&#x27;ve travelled a lot and I&#x27;ve not seen this in other countries.",
