  "text" : "Imagine half of them would be all Asian and not just the big bucks international focused ones like Squid Game. But local ones not tailored for it. You&#x27;ll tune out soon. It&#x27;s like going for a regular cinema but getting an arthouse collection.<p>I travel a lot (at least before Corona) and sometimes Netflix would not even allow me to continue watching a movie in the hotel, in the same subtitle language as I watched it before. Because I connected from an IP in Romania I&#x27;m suddenly supposed to speak their language too :S Because the options for captions in other languages disappear. This really annoyed me as I often would pop up in different countries and using a VPN was too slow on crappy hotel WiFi.<p>It&#x27;s this kind of shortsighted vision that I argue against. The world is not that simple. Maybe in the US it is but not everywhere.",
