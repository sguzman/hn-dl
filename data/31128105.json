  "text" : "&gt; D&amp;I is not discrimination against straight white men.<p>Well, it isn&#x27;t. As a straight white man myself, I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m particularly suffering from discrimination. Am I picked first for everything now, like maybe before I would have? Maybe not. Does it adversely impact my life? Not really.<p>It&#x27;s OK to let others to have the first sip from the fountain once in awhile, and you can help lift up historically-persecuted people without it necessarily being a loss for you. Attitude goes a long way in helping yourself be at peace with it.<p>If you&#x27;re a straight white man and you&#x27;re feeling seriously oppressed by D&amp;I, I&#x27;d like to hear from you personally and understand your situation better.<p>Anyway, this is pretty far afield from the discussion, which is really about specifically how media is harming people and children in particular.",
