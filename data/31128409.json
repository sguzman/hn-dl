Frankly comments like this lower the quality of the discussion.<p>If you want to know why D&amp;I is an issue, it&#x27;s because it is re-entrenching all of the stereotypes by hamhandedly trying to give everyone different handicaps, like life can be simplified to a game of golf. The reality, though, is that it doesn&#x27;t matter what handicap I&#x27;m given, due to my poor golf game I&#x27;m never going to play against Tiger Woods.<p>The only thing the handicaps change is what we&#x27;re measuring, and at some point people decide not to play the game, or lobby to change the rules. Look at the resurgence of the far right: it is D&amp;I which gave them the resentment in people&#x27;s souls to which they could place their hooks.",
