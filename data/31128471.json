  "text" : "I very recently downloaded because I just couldn&#x27;t manage to acquire the movie I wanted to watch in any other way.<p>I looked for it in all platforms, Netflix, Prime, Apple TV, YouTube, Play Store,  and it wasn&#x27;t available in my country. I then connected to the US through a VPN and tried to buy it or rent it but my PayPal account didn&#x27;t work because it isn&#x27;t associated to the US. I finally found it in YouTube posted by a page that seemed official! But it had no captions... argh!<p>I wasted 2 hours trying to have anyone accept money to let me watch it, but got nothing. Then I tried torrenting and 3 min after I had the movie ready to watch and a captions file ready to add. In the end I couldn&#x27;t finish watching the movie because it had already taken too long.",
