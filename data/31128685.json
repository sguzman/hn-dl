  "text" : "All the handwringing over Netflix subscriber loss seems to be overlooking the fact that they raised their prices - significantly. Of course they could lose subscribers from doing that. But 200k subscribers out of 150 million? Combined with the end of the pandemic and sky high inflation meaning many people have less opportunity to watch and less money to spend. The fact they raised their prices something like 20% and lost less than 1% of their subscriber base in that environment could almost be seen as a positive.<p>The there is definitely a question whether, now that they have moved so solidly into content production, Netflix is actually a scalable &#x2F; viable company any more. When they were just sending other people&#x27;s content around and doing it much cheaper and better that was innovative and different. But content production is an expensive treadmill you can never get off and unless they find a way to innovate on that front, they are up against much more experienced and well established players with no differentiator at all.<p>But reading the sky falling into the current reported figures seems a little over the top.",
