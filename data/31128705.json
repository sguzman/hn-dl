  "text" : "What people don&#x27;t realize is that part of the pricing model for various physical media is that the media wouldn&#x27;t last. VHS tapes, CDs, DVDs, etc all age, get lost, break, get scratches, whatever. They&#x27;re not &quot;forever&quot;.<p>Now you can say &quot;I can make a digital backup of my DVD&quot;. Depending on your jurisdiction you may have the rights to do that. But your own backup of that is unlikely to be durable.<p>A cloud copy of something on Google, Apple, Amazon or Netflix is essentially forever.<p>People don&#x27;t realize what they&#x27;re effectively asking for is digital rights to something in perpetuity. And you can&#x27;t really price that realistically.<p>Streaming services actually far better match what users actually want (in general). There&#x27;s no issues of storing media or keeping digital copies safe. The limited time you can view something is what makes it economical.<p>Remember too that most things tend to only ever be watched once. The satisfaction for collection isn&#x27;t relaly about repeat viewing at for the most part.",
