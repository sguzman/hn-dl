  "text" : "&gt;If youâ€™d like to actually defend a position against D&amp;I and how it is actually net harmful<p>Because it&#x27;s racist and sexist? Because it reduces people to their skin color and gender? Because it implicitly reinforces the notion that minorities are &quot;different&quot; and forces us to nonsensically pretend that differences can only be positive in cooperative environments? Because it suggests that minorities need special advantages to level the playing field? Because top to bottom it is not a cohesive, consistent, or rational policy and implies that all inequities are exclusively the result of discrimination on behalf of white males who have been made into a target, are having their voices silenced, their job opportunities removed, and their livelihoods threatened for self advocating?<p>On one hand your ideology implies that all of this is deserved because of the past and necessary for an equitable future, but then at the same time you blatantly deny that any of it&#x27;s happening and shame anyone who speaks up against this discrimination by calling them bigoted. It&#x27;s insanity.",
