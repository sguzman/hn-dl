  "text" : "I completely agree. I was only lightly using Netflix so when they last raised prices it was the push I needed to actually cancel. The recent content they&#x27;ve rolled out doesn&#x27;t justify the heftier price tag compared to competitors. I love the UX of Netflix, but content rules and they&#x27;re losing that battle. I don&#x27;t even want to try new shows because of their reputation for cancelling things unceremoniously.",
