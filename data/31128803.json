  "text" : "Readers here love to crap all over Netflix, but it&#x27;s still the service I use most. Yes, the movie selection is lackluster and yes, they make a lot of mediocre shows (though often for niches where fans of that content may have few other options). But they also make some of my favorite shows of all time like Bojack Horseman, Big Mouth and Sex Education. And they&#x27;ve revived some of my favorite content of all time like Arrested Development, W&#x2F; Bob &amp; David and Wet Hot American Summer (with mixed results, but still). Not to mention a lot of fringy comedy that may have otherwise never been produced, like I Think You Should Leave, Aunty Donna and Middleditch and Schwartz.<p>And they&#x27;ve brought content into the mainstream (in the US) that we otherwise may have never seen, like Black Mirror and Squid Game.<p>Throw in some flagship nature documentaries, a ton of stand up specials and the occasional cultural phenomenon like Stranger Things and I still feel like Netflix is easily worth the cost. And just because they produce a lot of crap doesn&#x27;t negate any of the above. There is no number of Adam Sandler movies that will change how much I loved Michael Bolton&#x27;s Big, Sexy Valentine&#x27;s Day Special.",
