  "text" : "&gt; I don&#x27;t even want to try new shows because of their reputation for cancelling things unceremoniously<p>Ah, so I’m not alone in this! Nowadays, I typically only consider shows that have at least a few seasons, I will never ever try one with just one season. The chances of them killing it off are just too high, and that would ruin it completely for me.<p>I like to binge watch, I can’t enjoy that when they keep killing off shows. It feels like a restaurant with only starters.",
