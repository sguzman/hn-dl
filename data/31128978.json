  "text" : "Think I read somewhere that of one of their content production differentiators is their direct-to-consumer approach. Classically lots of content was produced for the &quot;average&quot; consumer. Netflix can use their subscriber data to create low-cost content for extremely niche consumers, who might love that extremely relevant production (think super edgy, super graphic, super cartoon, etc - the type of extremes not covered by the average).<p>Not sure how much this holds true anymore, as now many big players have direct-to-customer streaming, but just sharing since it was a neat thought when I first read it",
