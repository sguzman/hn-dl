  "text" : "I don’t think this really affects my point that the fragmentation situation is <i>infinitely</i> better with streaming music than it is with video.<p>Here’s - perhaps - a better explanation as to why.<p>The majority of major music labels - Sony&#x2F;BMG, Columbia, EMI, etc - have the majority of their music available on the majority of the available streaming services.<p>This situation is unfortunately <i>worsening</i> on video streaming platforms as every major studio and their brother wants to completely commit to their own service.<p>It’s even worse as the result of this weird licensing moving around is series and films being removed from services you’d previously subscribed too mainly for those particular shows or films.<p>The only result of this is value loss and confusion presented to the consumer - as the recent CNN+ disaster shows, along with Netflix’s flailing subscriber count.<p>The music streaming world is exponentially better. Like - subscribing to a music streaming service is actually worthwhile. Video streaming services decrease in value with every new one that is introduced.",
