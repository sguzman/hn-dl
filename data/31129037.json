  "text" : "I don&#x27;t personally pirate much, but I take umbrage at you characterizing it in this way. You seem to think that the issues of accessing media without subjecting yourself to user-hostile behaviors are wholly orthogonal to the issue of accessing media without paying for it. They aren&#x27;t.<p>Imagine a hypothetical universe where, in order to watch one of your movies, people had to a) pay you $1 and also b) let you punch them in the nose. Then, when people sensibly start pirating your content instead because they don&#x27;t want to get punched, you loudly proclaim that they are stealing the $1 you are owed.<p>That&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening here. People want to watch your content, and are willing to pay for it. But they don&#x27;t want to pay for it AND get punched in the nose. They pirate because your distributors, and by extension you yourself, have made it impossible to watch your content (and pay you!) in any other way.<p>I get that your natural rejoinder will be &quot;if the content is not worth being punched in the nose, just don&#x27;t watch it!&quot; Which is fair. Debatable, but fair. Just don&#x27;t come here pretending that all you have asked for is the reasonable sum of $1 when you are actually demanding that your customers subject themselves to the indignity of your fist.",
