In a 6 months I might join for a bit to watch some newer shows, then probably cancel again.<p>Raising prices works well perhaps if people are in love with the product or there is just no other alternative. But people have been auto paying and not really thinking much or using it, raising the prices is a decision point to re-evaluate the value of the service.",
