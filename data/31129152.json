  "text" : "I think it&#x27;s because most of the time the &quot;politics&quot; that are objected to tend to be things like having an LGBT character in a show. While it&#x27;s probably not true that <i>everyone</i> who complains about &quot;politics&quot; on TV these days are objecting to LGBT people, it is almost certainly true that everyone who watches TV and gets disgusted by seeing an LGBT character will code their disgust in terms of &quot;being tired of politics&quot; shoved down their throat, etc.<p>Thus it tends to be very likely that the person complaining about &quot;politics&quot; is simply masking a disgust of others&#x27; identities, but doesn&#x27;t want to get into specifics because it would be a bad look. Therefore the question asking for specifics is interpreted as a way to pick a fight, because they know what might ensue if they actually got into specifics.",
