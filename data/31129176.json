I pirate some times sure but I do so with the understanding that what I am doing is unethical and try to avoid it.<p>Consuming media&#x2F;entertainment is no human right and if it is too expensive&#x2F;too inaccessible&#x2F;whatever and you wish to be ethical, don&#x27;t pirate it in the first place.<p>Humans have great difficulty controlling their impulses especially in connection to crimes that are undetectable and easy to perform but the honest will at least own up to what they do.",
