  "text" : "&gt; It&#x27;s this American view that the whole world is &#x27;like America with just a different locale setting&#x27; I find really annoying.<p>Sure, at the local movie theater we have Indian films (probably multiple regions), Korean films, Chinese ones, sometimes Spanish and so on. English is hardly the only language around. My wife (Chinese) consumes a lot of Korean dramas on Netflix.<p>My feeling about Switzerland when living there is that it was slightly less multi-cultural than the states, having a much stronger desire for immigrants to  assimilate and become &quot;suisse&quot; (but disclaimer, I was living on the French side). You can still find the multi-cultural stuff, but version originale is the exception, not the rule.",
