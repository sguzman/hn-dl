  "text" : "Many of the big tech stocks are <i>insanely</i> overpriced according to traditional investment measures. The rational reasons to support those prices are expectations of similarly extreme future growth or a belief that it might be a speculative investment but the dollars will keep pouring in.<p>The discussions this week aren&#x27;t just a wobble, they&#x27;re about whether Netflix can still generate that kind of extraordinary future growth. If there&#x27;s even a strong hint that it might not then the speculative bubble bursts. If there&#x27;s a serious expectation that it won&#x27;t then the growth investors are out as well. One stock price crash, coming right up.",
