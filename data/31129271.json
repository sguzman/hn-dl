The same ways we&#x27;ve always found other things we like really.<p><i>I can&#x27;t imagine how wasteful it would be to have to buy all these bad shows instead of just streaming them.</i><p>I have a significant disc collection of movies and TV shows I enjoy. I have almost nothing I haven&#x27;t rewatched at least once and enjoyed again and&#x2F;or lent to friends or family at some point for them to enjoy as well. I don&#x27;t really know how that happened but I can tell you that almost none of those discs were bought as new releases other than big names that I was already fairly sure I&#x27;d enjoy or sequels&#x2F;spin-offs of things I&#x27;d previously enjoyed.",
