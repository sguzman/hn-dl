  "text" : "I have trouble imagining what the games &#x2F; movies hybrid of the future will be.  It&#x27;s clear something is changing (game revenue exceeds hollywood - even if that&#x27;s not a totally fair comparison).<p>There is a VR-movie called Pearl   by an ex-Disney director - you basically sit in a passenger seat watching the plot but can turn your head etc.<p>Take that one step further and be at the table with Michael Corleone and the Police Captain.  But what happens if you wonder out into the kitchen  and check on the veal.  Linearity and emotion get sacrificed.  But the techniques games designers find to bring our attention will undoubtedly be useful for journalists and campaigners to highlight real issues, and marketers to highlight crap.<p>My guess is we either find you cannot get the mass of humanity to focus on one thing, and that news cycles and games will just be sharded - the people who know about and care about this space battle are limited, just like those that care about the fifth series of this tv show or the text of an a to of parliament.<p>I doubt we shall all have a more curated world - it&#x27;s hard to imagine any media outlet having the sort of range of power TV stations of the 60s and 70s did.  But maybe we can all have a better shared mental model of the world - so what is truly(!) important is perceived important by most people.  This might be a bit naive -  it if games are simplified models and faithfully represent the world maybe we will learn.  Most Sim games generally teach co-operative politics in the end<p>I can sense it matters.  I just don&#x27;t understand it.  I do wonder if i played more games it might help !",
