  "text" : "That’s fair - but also remasters can be subjective. For instance - I vastly prefer most of the original Beatles masters to the 2010’s remasters. Point is that we’re almost comparing 128kbps MP3 to CD quality with DVD vs. Blu-Ray.<p>Many Blu-Rays are remasters of the originals as well - so, it’s kinda moot with remasters. My point is with the massive quality difference, and that DVD’s in general will only get less worthwhile as time goes on.",
