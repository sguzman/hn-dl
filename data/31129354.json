  "text" : "I just saw via a post on Reddit [0] that Netflix IS going to adding ads, or at least offering a lower&#x2F;cheaper tier that has ads. But we all know where this ends and even if ads don&#x27;t creep into full-price subscriptions I&#x27;m about done. I&#x27;m struggling to point to a Netflix show that I couldn&#x27;t live without, or couldn&#x27;t binge in less than 1 month if needed. The main reason I still have my account, and why I kept it through the price increase, is I have at least 4 friends mooching off my account. Looking at watch histories they all use it more than I do by a long shot, my last watched show was in January, they all have multiple in the last few days. If they crack down on password sharing this I&#x27;m out as well. Really it feels like just a matter of time, sharing crackdowns, another price increase, or ads and I&#x27;ll cancel.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;popculture.com&#x2F;streaming&#x2F;news&#x2F;netflix-officially-adding-commercials&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;popculture.com&#x2F;streaming&#x2F;news&#x2F;netflix-officially-add...</a>",
