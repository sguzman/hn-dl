  "text" : "&gt;But from the perspective of someone with a libre media setup, all these streaming&#x2F;DRM&#x2F;lockdown tribulations are like watching a storm from inside a warm house with a hot cup of cocoa. Especially on a technical forum where people should know better than to succumb to corporate ploys, its worth reminding everyone of that.<p>ehh, It&#x27;s more like a speedbump than a storm. There&#x27;s too much money in the game for it to end up being caught in a hurricane.<p>I just see the other side on how piracy can also harm more niche mediums and discourage businesses from even bothering to compete, which is why I can&#x27;t even say piracy is a &#x27;meh&#x27; at worst.<p>The manga indusry outside of Japan has this problem in that it&#x27;s 5+ years behind the already decade outdated online solution for digital comics. Several JP storefronts for phyical and digital manga, but that is almost non-existent in English. Manga is fantranslated so fast that there&#x27;s no incentive to bother having official localizers outside of the already huge works. Easier to cash in pennies on anime adaptations and merch sales afterwards.",
