  "text" : "Netflix was already willing to alienate users by stooping to conditional joint acquisitions.<p>Better Call Saul is proudly labeled a &quot;Netflix Original&quot;.<p>But you couldn&#x27;t watch season five on Netflix until April, even though it originally aired two years ago.<p>Had to let AMC reair it first, right?<p>Think season six will air on schedule with AMC in August?<p>Meanwhile, HBO Max, and Hulu by extension, released The Batman nearly on time with theatres.<p>It&#x27;s clear that Netflix simply lacks the content creation supply chain of its competitors.<p>And no amount of price hikes, ads, excuses, or desperate back-door deals will solve that.<p>Their greatest hope was to capitalize on successful originals, like Love Death and Robots.<p>But in three years they&#x27;ve managed to deliver only two season of that show.<p>Which, even with the pandemic, should have occurred much faster given it&#x27;s an animated anthology.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if I woke up one morning to find news of a Sony and&#x2F;or Paramount buy out.",
