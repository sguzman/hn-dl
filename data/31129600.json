  "text" : "There&#x27;s a lot of new competition in Disney+, Discovery+, Paramount+, and Peacock. Why now?<p>&gt; 71% of TV households nationwide have some form of pay-TV service.  The percentage of TV households that have a live pay-TV service (via cable, satellite, Telco, or Internet-delivered vMVPD) is down from 82% in 2016, 87% in 2011, and 86% in 2006.<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.satellitemarkets.com&#x2F;71-percent-us-households-have-pay-tv-service\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.satellitemarkets.com&#x2F;71-percent-us-households-hav...</a><p>A second source that classifies vMVPD differently: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.emarketer.com&#x2F;chart&#x2F;239301&#x2F;us-pay-tv-vs-non-pay-tv-households-2016-2024-millions\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.emarketer.com&#x2F;chart&#x2F;239301&#x2F;us-pay-tv-vs-non-pay-...</a><p>Combined with the decline of movie theaters, it&#x27;s an existential crisis for everyone in the media world. Can they replace lost cable&#x2F;theater revenues with streaming subscriptions?<p>I expect we&#x27;ll end up with a 2 or 3 major media companies and a couple small premium services bolted onto unrelated products like Prime and Apple TV. Netflix has some short term headwinds with this new competition but is the only company that&#x27;s a shoe-in for making it.",
