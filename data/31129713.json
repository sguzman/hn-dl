  "text" : "I think you are straw manning vs steel manning the argument. I don&#x27;t think people mind the inclusion of LGBQT or POC people in shows. I don&#x27;t think people mind even the occasional artificial inclusions - e.g. Mr. Rogers did a great job of bringing in kids with special needs and helped the audience understand that they were people too. He also showed how whites and blacks could be friends and equals in a time when this was still a bit controversial in some pockets of the country.<p>What bugs people, me included, is very different. It is the forced inclusion of diversity seemingly everywhere. It is the constant subtle messages of &quot;white man evil&quot; in shows where it doesn&#x27;t add to the plot. It is stuff like the Oscars being explicit about requiring minority leads. It is the one sided diversity where blacks, browns and Muslims are protected but it is perfectly acceptable to make racist jokes about white people or say Christians. It is the subtle shaming of anything conservative.<p>FYI I am mixed race, liberal, and not Christian. I am also of child rearing age and don&#x27;t like seeing my kids being indoctrinated at so many levels.",
