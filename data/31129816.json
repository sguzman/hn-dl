  "text" : "They published some shareholder statement years back saying &quot;The quality of the programming does not seem to correlate with how much most users consume&quot;.<p>So there you go.  I found the same, 10 years back I would read about something amazing and critically acclaimed -- and they&#x27;d have it!<p>Now rarely do they.  But, my wife and I still watch a lot of Netflix.  It is the service which seems to have many things she wants to watch and a good amount of things we both want to watch.<p>Things only I want to watch I mostly find on Hulu and HBOMax.  Or I have to watch them the old fashioned way because they are too obscure to be on a streaming platform.",
