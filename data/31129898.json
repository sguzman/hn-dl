  "text" : "The elephant in the room is that the quality has been plummeting. I used to watch Netflix for MCU content. Guess where I get that now. There were also shows like Adventure Time, My Little Pony, Schindler&#x27;s List, none of which are on Netflix now.<p>Netflix content is mediocre. I loved Squid Game and The Queen&#x27;s Gambit, but they felt padded and I fast forwarded through them. A lot of their other other content is shock and sex, which I presume gets people to binge.<p>But there&#x27;s only so long you can keep dropping quality before people leave.",
