  "text" : "&gt; They published some shareholder statement years back saying &quot;The quality of the programming does not seem to correlate with how much most users consume&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s not particularly informative, though. It could be true right now. &quot;Users&quot; is not a group with a fixed population.<p>If they drive their content quality into the ground and hemorrhage users as a direct result, it would still be true that the quality of the content was uncorrelated with the amount that users consumed. Instead, quality of the content would correlate with <i>number of users</i>. But the users are always people who are willing to deal with whatever the current content is!<p>What&#x27;s weird is that, as a flat-rate subscription service, they&#x27;re already aware that increasing number of users is good, while increasing the amount of content that users consume is bad.",
