  "text" : "One of the most overlooked trends of the 21st century is we have too much entertainment.  When I was growing up, when a movie came out, you went and saw it because it wasn&#x27;t going to be on TV for at least 8 months and then you could get a VHS like years afterward if you were lucky.  When it came on TV it was a big deal.  Everyone got home in time to watch it.  Now entertainment is everywhere.  It&#x27;s in massive and overwhelmingly cheap quantities.  The point of diminishing marginal returns has been reached and now quality becomes paramount.  Netflix just doesn&#x27;t have the quality, so they are going to slowly bleed off attention and subscribers because people just don&#x27;t have the time to watch everything.  When Netflix came out, sure it was incredible, watch as much as you want for free, but now that&#x27;s not as enticing.",
