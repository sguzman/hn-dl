  "text" : "For one it&#x27;s piracy, not theft. They are both legally and morally distinct. You&#x27;re being deprived of a <i>potential</i> future profit rather than having a direct loss.<p>&gt; When you decide that the exact moral high point is to consume the goods and services while still maintaining integrity about not providing the cash value asked of those things, you are justifying being a [pirate].<p>Correct, it is justifying being a pirate. The justification being exactly what you suggested: voting with my wallet. I want to watch a certain piece of entertainment, but it&#x27;s producer has made it unreasonably unobtainable thus pirating it signals that it is both desired and that a sale was lost.<p>I think you&#x27;re being angry about the wrong thing here. Consumers don&#x27;t want to pirate; they are pushed to piracy by shit service. That&#x27;s not a fault of the consumers, that&#x27;s a fault of the seller. If you actually want to reduce piracy you should be advocating for better service rather than telling people they&#x27;re stealing from you.",
