  "text" : "It&#x27;s funny because I used to sound just like you. But now I am much more sympathetic to the above comment. I spent a lot of my youth enjoying films by a bunch of foreign filmmakers including:<p>Ozu\nBergman\nFellini\nSuzuki\nClouzot\nBresson\nKurosawa\nMizoguchi\nCosta-Gavras\nHerzog\nRenoir\nand on and on<p>I especially loved the films of Jean Pierre Melville, Masaki Kobayashi and Anrei Tarkovsky. And yet, when I am done with a long day of work and chores, I cannot stomach anything with subtitles. Exhaustion plays a part in it. It just feels like work after a long day. And I wouldn&#x27;t want to have that experience of any of the movies I loved back then, seeing them as a chore to be tolerated.",
