  "text" : "When everything was bundled together, we complained about paying for things we didn&#x27;t use. Unbundling was initially cheaper because it was just extra profit on the side.<p>Now, it&#x27;s becoming the primary business model and has to stand on its own.<p>It turns out economy of scale is real, and we&#x27;ve lost it. Other people were paying for our content before, but not watching it. How does real public educational content get funded in this new world? Most of us probably agree that there should be quality, unbiased content.<p>Cashflow consistency has a value as well, so subscribing and unsubscribing creates a cost that needs to get covered by someone. Currently, the loyal subscribers.<p>I&#x27;m not saying things can&#x27;t improve, just that many unrealistic, entitled attitudes exist. Content is better now than before as providers have to compete more to get subscribers, so the value is greater.",
