The fancy restaurant is targeting the elite, and excluding the poor. The soup kitchen is targeting the poor, and it&#x27;d be ridiculous for Elon Musk to demand food from them - but they&#x27;d probably still serve him if he showed up.<p>Analogously, it feels like you&#x27;re trying to use the existence of soup kitchens to defend restaurants.<p>(To be clear, I&#x27;m not saying restaurants are evil, or that clothing brands are an act of charity. Just trying to illustrate why people are going to have different intuitions on Abercrombie -vs- clothes for black people)",
