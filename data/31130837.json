  "text" : "Without being a &quot;racist homophobic bigot&quot;, you can be tired of seing that every single TV show they produce seems to absolutely <i>need</i> to play the race&#x2F;gender&#x2F;sexual orientation bingo.<p>To me, it feels like the &quot;diversity&quot; of the characters included in a script is one of the factor that is taken into account when deciding to finance a show or not. It really shouldn&#x27;t be: either a script is good enough and you should finance it, or it isn&#x27;t and you should reject it. But adding artificial additional criteria just means that good scripts will be rejected and less good one will be accepted. And the logical consequence is that sometimes it feels like perfectly good stories are altered in a way that ensure more &quot;diversity&quot; is ensured, often times making the story worse.<p>And finally, casting is sometimes...weird to say the least. That does not help producing better shows.",
