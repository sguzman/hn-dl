  "text" : "&quot;Disingenuous&quot;?  You link to a Wikipedia article based on two or three papers -- when there are centuries of scholarship on Rome -- and _I_ am &quot;disingenuous&quot;?<p>Pieces like this are the telephone game played by ideologues.  Get a couple of articles published, never mind the sourcing or review, cite them as &quot;scholarly&quot; and voila! evidence of . . . whatever the hell it is you want evidence of.<p>If gay marriage were a thing in ancient Rome, or Greece, we&#x27;d know this.  There would be a list of examples as long as your arm.  We wouldn&#x27;t have to look to a couple of obscure journal articles to establish it.  And btw? Nero isn&#x27;t exactly a role model of proper behavior in any one&#x27;s eyes.<p>No one but a partisan would regard this as &quot;evidence&quot;.  Please stop with such nonsense.",
