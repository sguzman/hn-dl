  "text" : "Agreed except a lot of my old CDs aren&#x27;t available on Spotify. I do plan on ripping a select portion of them when I find them again. But it&#x27;ll only consist of my favorite records and unavailable.<p>Before I do that though, I&#x27;m going to check into Youtube Music. It&#x27;s possible what I don&#x27;t find on Spotify is available there.<p>Movies, I don&#x27;t find many are missing from services. Perhaps the movies I loved were less obscure than the music. I don&#x27;t plan on ripping a single DVD or VHS tape.",
