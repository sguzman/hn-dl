  "text" : "Often when you have to qualify something (<i>intellectual</i> property instead of just property), it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s used as a metaphor instead of a subcategory. Intellectual property is a form of property as much as political science is a form of science.<p>You can metaphorically say it&#x27;s theft, but it doesn&#x27;t manifest as theft of actual property.<p>For example: many people (myself included) have downloaded the $1.000.000 torrent (a list of files whose value amounts to a million dollars). I found nothing of use in it so I just deleted it. Did I cause a million dollars in damages? Was the damage restored when I deleted it?<p>If you consider the same for actual property there&#x27;s no question about it. Stealing a Bugatti does cause millions to be lost, and destroying it makes it irrecoverable.",
