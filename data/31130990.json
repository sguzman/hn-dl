  "text" : "Too many foreign dramas tbh. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I don&#x27;t object to their existence on the platform and even watch a lot of them. But if your goal is to retain US subscribers, it&#x27;s absolutely the wrong play to spend so much of your licensing budget acquiring another mediocre K-Drama. Especially when so many good foreign dramas remain trapped in their home markets.",
