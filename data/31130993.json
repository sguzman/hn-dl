  "text" : "In France the dubbing is very well done and some movies are even better when dubbed. I still watch movies in the original language with subtitles but some 90&#x27;s movies like <i>Back to the Future</i> are even better dubbed in French. There are even YouTube channels dedicated to dubbed movies where they invite dubbing actors, etc.",
