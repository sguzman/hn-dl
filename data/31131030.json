  "text" : "I have wached a bunch of stuff with subtitles, mostly anime. But more recently even movies, esp. recent movies(I find the sound balance off, effects are too loud and voices too soft).<p>That said, subtitles can be very distracting. You end up focusing on the word and missing things in the scene&#x2F;shot as well as the background.<p>Also the subtitles are not always faithful to the dialog. A good example of this is watching One Piece in English w&#x2F; Subs on Netflix. The spoken dialog will be one thing, the written will be another. I have some Japanese knowledge and can tell you that the subs(and the dubs) definitely do not reflect the feeling in some scenes.",
