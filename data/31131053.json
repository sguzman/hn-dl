If I hadn&#x27;t had the common sense in high school to back it all up to my hard drive, it would be gone forever. that was a tough wake up call that I don&#x27;t own any media I &quot;buy&quot; from Apple&#x2F;Amazon&#x2F;etc. I&#x27;m renting it until they&#x27;re done hosting it.<p>Yo ho yo ho, back to my old life I go.",
