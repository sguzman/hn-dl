Same thing happens on Twitter, everything reacts to clicks. If 95% of the screen space is listening for clicks and mouse-over&#x27;s then you have to be really careful not to misclick on something. It&#x27;s even worse if you like to run everything through TTS - just try to double-click select something without triggering the click event listeners.",
