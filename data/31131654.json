  "text" : "&gt; For TV shows, when they do produce something of quality they often dump it if it doesn&#x27;t find an audience immediately or it doesn&#x27;t drive &quot;new subscribers&quot;.<p>Or they make a second season so atrocious that they lose the entire audience. For example, the first season of Altered Carbon is one of the best &quot;hard&quot; sci-fi I&#x27;ve ever seen in a TV show. The second season was supposed to have a much bigger budget and had an A-list lead. But it was so horrible that I couldn&#x27;t even finish watching it.",
