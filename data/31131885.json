  "text" : "&gt;Yes, really. A story about Christian values is going to come off as political to Hindu or Muslim viewers.<p>Not necessarily.  If Netflix had 10,000 shows and some of them were stories about Christian values, some were about Hindu values, and some were about Muslim values, nobody reasonable would have a problem with it.  However, if all 10,000 shows made a forced effort to somehow include Christian values, or always had to shoehorn at least one character openly wearing a cross and saying a prayer into every show, it would rub on people the wrong way.  That&#x27;s how it is with Netflix original programming.  You can break out your &quot;woke&quot; bingo card for any Netflix original show, no matter what it is purportedly about, and score bingo every time.  Not every show has to include a facet of the same political agenda.  Even if you happen to agree with that agenda, there is something to be said about diversity (true diversity - diversity of thought, not the fake kind peddling on Netflix).",
