  "text" : "&gt; One of the most overlooked trends of the 21st century is we have too much entertainment.\nThat&#x27;s some deep insight right there.\nI used to watch netflix while eating alone only. I unsubscribed Jan 2022, and now I read a book on an ereader on a stand at eye level. Much more value for me and as entertaining if not more.<p>It&#x27;s not entertainment, it&#x27;s education.<p>The challenge now is to find and filter &#x27;useful books&#x27; (most are not, and don&#x27;t deliver on the promise on the  cover).",
