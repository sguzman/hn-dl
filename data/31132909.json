Yeah you didn&#x27;t physically take anything from me, but you are having access to something you shouldn&#x27;t without paying.&quot;<p>And this is again a physical situation, where one more person takes up limited space, reducing something.<p>Copying does not reduce anything.<p>It also does not contribute anything, true, so I am not saying it is always ethical to do so.<p>But when a poor person in bangladesh or bolivia living under very different economic realities, where 10$ means a LOT and who could never afford to pay for western realities anyway, streams some hollywood movie from a warez site - than I see zero damage. And guess what, they all do. So do poor teenagers and students in the west and they usually start paying, once they can afford it.<p>Judging them all as &quot;thefts&quot; from a position of being born into wealth, is maybe not very ethical either. \nSo to repeat it again, stealing implies taking something away. Which is not the case here.",
