May 2016 increased from 9 to 10.  August 2019 from 10 to 12.  March 2021 from 12 to 13.  April 2022 from 13 to 15.  (All prices euro and rounded up one penny).<p>I cancelled the day the last hike arrived - it&#x27;s the least amount of time between raises, as was the previous raise before it. At the same time, their offer is getting more and more disappointing, and they&#x27;re talking publicly about reducing their content spend and the possibility of adverts.<p>I feel like they&#x27;re hooked on a growth bubble, and now that they&#x27;re reaching market saturation the only way they can maintain that bubble is to squeeze it out of us - charge more, deliver less - which as a user is the complete opposite of value for money, so I&#x27;m out.",
