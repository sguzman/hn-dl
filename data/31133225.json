  "text" : "&gt;but some 90&#x27;s movies like Back to the Future are even better dubbed in French.<p>what do you mean by this, that the French language is so much better that it renders the movie better by using it? Or is it that the writers translating the English to French are better and make the movies more interesting by their choices?<p>&gt;There are even YouTube channels dedicated to dubbed movies where they invite dubbing actors, etc.<p>Or is it that the dubbing actors are better speakers than the original actors, for example most actors when they do voiceovers suck because they aren&#x27;t trained for it I guess, and maybe a dubbed actor is trained for it or... I guess I am just confused by how a dubbing could improve a really good movie although I might suppose it would be possible to improve a really bad movie in this way.<p>So how does this work?<p>If it is a replicable aesthetic phenomenon you might expect people to aesthetically choose to make movies in this way, to make better movies.",
