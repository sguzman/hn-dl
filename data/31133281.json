Especially in a country where about 25% of the population is from abroad.<p>My knowledge of French is basically non existent so showing stuff that is only available in French is completely useless to me. Even worse, it&#x27;s confusing as I am not sure if there even is a German version on the site or not.<p>The strange thing is my profile is set to German. A better experience would be if I could set my preferred languages. If you would get fancy, add sub title options to the mix.",
