  "text" : "I agree neither dubs nor subtitles are 100% faithful to the original. By necessity, they cannot be. There&#x27;s no such thing as a perfect translation even with books, but with TV&#x2F;cinema you also have to keep the pace, which makes things doubly difficult.<p>Even then, just hearing the original language, even if you don&#x27;t understand the words, conveys essential emotion. I like to hear the original voice actors, which are essential for the cartoon&#x2F;anime (even more with live action movies, of course).",
