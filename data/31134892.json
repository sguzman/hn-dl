  "text" : "Agreed with the author of this news, the content killed netflix.  In the last two years of pandemic and WFH, more people paid attention to the online streaming and willing to spend more.  It didn&#x27;t take long before you&#x27;d learn who&#x27;s content hold the better quality. Netflix has been relying on foreign contents approximately 70% if not 50% in the recent years.\nI wouldn&#x27;t say netflix is completely out of favor at this point but definitely lost its edge comparing to others. It has occurred to me I could go on by weeks on HBOmax, Hulu and Amazon without missing Netflix, among which two are bundled with wireless plan and Prime membership, Hulu is cheaper with commercial. If it comes to paying full price I&#x27;d probably cut Netflix without a blink.",
