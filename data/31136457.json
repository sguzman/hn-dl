  "text" : "Eh, I&#x27;m gay and I still agree: those types of shows get a bit boring sometimes. I&#x27;m all for representation but it shouldn&#x27;t be <i>the only point</i> of a show: it shouldn&#x27;t be &quot;here&#x27;s Ghostbusters, the exact same film all over again, <i>but with women</i>!&quot;, or &quot;here&#x27;s Ocean&#x27;s Eleven, the exa&quot;- eh, you get the point.<p>I&#x27;m sure some people will hotly contest that these shows&#x2F;movies are genuinely works of art, and representation just happens to be a bonus, but that&#x27;s not how it feels when watching a load of this tedious paint-by-numbers pablum.<p>(This isn&#x27;t to say that there are no instances where I feel the opposition to minority&#x2F;female casting was driven more by bigotry than by people&#x27;s finely-honed critical faculties. Of course there are. But I happen to think it cuts both ways in this case: many of those shows&#x2F;movies <i>are just godawful</i>, and trade on the &quot;you&#x27;re a bigot if you don&#x27;t like this!&quot; card to drive sympathy&#x2F;virtue demand, from people who want to feel like Rosa Parks for going to the cinema.)",
