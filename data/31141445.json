  "text" : "An example is the complete unnecessary cast of Caroline Henderson (a black woman) to the series &quot;Vikings: Valhalla&quot;. I understand it is a fictional story, but these are Vikings for pete&#x27;s sake. The only reason they cast her was evidently for diversity reasons. It is a distraction to the story, I immediately turned off. Though we know that not all vikings had blonde hair, some may be even a bit more dark skinned, but definitely not black. And it is more laughable because she&#x27;s a character that yields some power in the Viking society. Laughable and a distraction to the story.<p>Another example of a series that, instead of focusing on its central theme, ends up injecting politically-motivated content is the series &quot;High Score&quot;. Listen, I understand that a small portion of early video game enthusiasts care about those things, but for a series that has a purpose to tell the relevant stories about creation and development of video games in the 80s and 90s, you just can&#x27;t help but to think that they felt that they needed to inject some LGBT content in it such as in episode 3 on the story about the 1st LGBT RPG game GayBlade. They end  up leaving more relevant content on the table to shoehorn these themes into the series. Not everything needs to be &quot;gay&quot;, or having a &quot;gay angle&quot;.",
