  "text" : "&gt; If you make a prediction of +2.5m new subscriptions, during a pandemic and associated economic flux, and the prediction doesn’t pan out, the only thing that’s happened is that you made a bad prediction.<p>I mean, that’s demonstrably false. The world works by individuals taking action based on expected outcomes. That crosses species and pervades every waking moment of life. It is involved in things as simple as walking and as complex as mate selection, migration or  habitation choices among thousands of others.<p>To treat this instance of variance between expected outcomes and reality as somehow different makes little sense.",
