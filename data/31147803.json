  "text" : "Few months ago I rage quit Netflix because their shows would start autoplaying and nothing I did could disable that. I couldn&#x27;t read one synopsis distraction free or browse without having to constantly click my GTV remote just to stop the friggin thing from playing. WTF! I&#x27;d like to think there were more like me who voted by cancelling their subscriptions. I hope PMs at Netflix who forced this onto their users lost their jobs.",
