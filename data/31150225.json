  "text" : "There&#x27;s one part of the article that I think deserves more attention. I see Netflix in a big disjointed mess of entertainment.<p>I&#x27;ve got Netflix and then someone will tell me about something very interesting on Hulu, Amazon Prime, HBO, or Showtime. I&#x27;m not gonna sign up for Hulu just to watch 1 movie or a series. I&#x27;m not gonna give Comcast more money just so that I can get HBO and a whole lot of other channels that I don&#x27;t want.<p>And the marketplace is so complicated. I can pay Comcast to get the History Channel (and a lot of channels that I don&#x27;t want) or, I could go to another steaming service and get History Channel, but you&#x27;ve gotta look into the details to discover that the &quot;new&quot; episodes are actually 1 season behind.<p>So, when I think about dropping Netflix, it&#x27;s not because Netflix in and of itself is lacking or too expensive. It&#x27;s more about throwing up my hands and quitting the madness of the whole marketplace.",
