But in general and in my experience, it&#x27;s not common even in this case.<p>Spanish dubs of anim√© are sometimes good. All English dubs I&#x27;ve heard are atrocious. I remember one of the first dubs that was lauded was the English dub of Princess Mononoke... and it&#x27;s hilariously bad, even if it has big names doing the voices. The Japanese version is the best, but even the Spanish dub is better.",
