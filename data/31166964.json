  "text" : "I think this both misses the point and is incredibly insightiful at the same time. A cover of a known song may be better (it happens!), but you&#x27;d never claim you heard the original song if all you listened to is the cover.<p>A dub is like a cover, agreed. Almost always, a terrible cover. I can always tell when I incorrectly set the language on Netflix to something other than the original -- you can immediately tell it&#x27;s a dub because of the drop in voice acting quality. English dubs are particularly terrible, it&#x27;s like the voice actors are emotionless drones, and when they try emotion, they use it in all the wrong places.<p>Besides, it&#x27;s disrespectful. An actor&#x2F;actress is not just their face and mannerisms. It&#x27;s their voices, too. The voices are an essential part of their acting (if you are deaf, you can&#x27;t help missing them, but if you are not, unless it&#x27;s a scene without speech, you&#x27;re missing a key ingredient). Saying &quot;ok, I&#x27;ll replace his voice with this other voice, and his face with with this other face I like better.. you know what? I&#x27;ll just edit him out of the movie and replace him with this other actor I like better!&quot; is way too scifi and post-cyberpunk dystopia for me. It&#x27;s just disrespectful.<p>I cannot honestly say I watched a movie if I watched it dubbed. I watched a cover instead.",
