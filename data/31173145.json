I assume it&#x27;s because while things like prime and gym memberships all the value comes from people signing up and not using it, but seems like Netflix likes to place their value on stream numbers and active users, which makes a little more sense as to why they&#x27;d want to constantly remind users that they have an active subscription. I&#x27;m not sure on the business end how that results in money for Netflix but I&#x27;ve also never looked into it.",
